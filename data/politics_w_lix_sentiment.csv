If you support Harris:

* We will probably get the same status quo Israel loving government we have had for the last 60+ years, but they might at least *try* to curb things.

If you support Trump:

* You will get the same situation in Israel-Gaza you have right now, but with them being told to ""finish what they started"" and to consider the nuclear option while on the phone with their leadership ""pretty much every day"" asking them to keep it going to hurt the election.

* You will see Ukraine collapse as Trump pulls aid and funding (which he withheld from Ukraine last time in office) for his buddy Putin, seeing a genocide there.

* You will get a new home-grown genocidal war against the LGBTQ+ citizenry or at the very least see them oppressed into slave-level ""rights"".

* You will see an all out war on anyone the GOP doesn't consider a ""good immigrant"".

* You will see new levels of racism and bigotry from the man who talks about burying ""fucking Mexicans"", ""vermin that are poisoning the lifeblood of the country"", hatred against Asian-Americans from the man who made popular ""kung flu"", and the ""enemy within"" that should apparently have US military used on them. All compiled with a planned Muslim ban and new religious hatred if you are not white evangelical.

* The new war on women, turning them into baby factories who can't divorce their husbands unless another man says that it is okay. Gilead is not something to which we should aspire.

Reagan used his power to influence Israeli war policy multiple times. 

Indeed, there were several instances where Reagan ordered warplanes and munitions to be delayed because they were going to be used against civilians and in ways America did not approve. 

And reportedly, the civilian casualties - particularly during the 1982 Lebanon War and when Israel attacked PLO targets - bothered him greatly and he found it deeply upsetting. Even writing of his disgust and the need to influence Israel in his diary.

For Reagan, the civilian casualties were an impetus for action as much as any other political reasons.

And Reagan wasn't the only Republican to play hardball with Israel...

Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened economic sanctions and an aid cutoff to force Israel to withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula after it invaded Egypt in 1956. 

Gerald R. Ford warned that he would re-evaluate the entire relationship in 1975 over what he considered Israel’s recalcitrance during peace talks with Egypt.

President Joe Biden said Thursday that the weekslong pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses haven’t changed his policy stance on Israel and the Middle East.

In his strongest direct remarks yet on the escalating protests, Biden criticized some of the protests as “not peaceful,” saying that they had disrupted classes and upcoming graduation ceremonies, and that vandalizing, trespassing, and occupying campus buildings wasn’t considered free speech.

“Violent protest in America is not protected. Peaceful protest is,” Biden said at the White House.

>Good morning.  Before I head to North Carolina, I wanted to speak for a few moments about what's going on on our college campuses here.  We've all seen images and they put to the test two fundamental American principles.  First is the right to free speech and for people to peacefully assemble and make their voices heard.  The second is the rule of law.  Both must be upheld.  

>We are not an authoritarian nation where we silence people or squash dissent.  The American people are heard.  In fact, peaceful protest is in the best American tradition of how Americans respond to consequential issues.  But - but - neither are we a lawless country.  We're a civil society, and order must prevail.  Throughout our history we've often faced moments like this because we are a big, diverse, free-thinking and freedom-loving nation.  In moments like this, there are always those who rush in to score political points.  But this isn't a moment for politics, it's a moment for clarity.  

>So let me be clear: peaceful protest in America - violent protest is not protected, peaceful protest is.  It's against the law when violence occurs; destroying property is not a peaceful protest it's against the law.  Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campuses, forcing the cancellation of classes and graduation, none of this is a peaceful protest.  Threatening people, intimidating people, instilling fear in people is not a peaceful protest, it's against the law.  Dissent is essential to democracy, but dissent must never lead to disorder or to denying the rights of other students can finish the semester and their college education.  

>Look, it's a matter of fairness, it's a matter of what's right.  There's the right to protest, but not the right to cause chaos.  People have the right to get an education, the right to get a degree, the right to walk across the campus safely without the fear of getting attacked.  

>Let's be clear about this as well: there should be no place on any campus, no place in America, for antisemitism or threats of violence against Jewish students.  There is no place for hate speech or violence of any kind, whether it's antisemitism or Islamophobia, or discrimination against Arab-Americans or Palestinian-Americans.  It's simply wrong. There is no place for racism in America; it's all wrong, it's unamerican.  

>I understand people have strong feelings and deep convictions.  In America, we respect the right and protect the right to express that, but it doesn't mean anything goes.  It needs to be done without violence, without destruction, without hate, and within the law.  Make no mistake, as president I will always defend free speech, and I will always be just as strong in standing up for the rule of law.  That's my responsibility to you, the American people, and my obligation to the Constitution.

2024-01-02 21:56:31,politics,Israel,18x1lfb,kg1cw3h,Bernie Sanders Calls On Congress To Reject Unconditional Military Aid To Israel,"Sen. Bernie Sanders called on Congress Tuesday to reject the $10.1 billion in unconditional military aid to Israel, citing “Netanyahu’s illegal and immoral war against the Palestinian People.” 

In a statement, Sanders said the supplemental funding bill gives aid “for the right-wing Netanyahu government to continue its brutal war against the Palestinian people.” 

“Enough is enough. Congress must reject that funding.

2023-11-05 14:24:43,politics,Israel,17od07z,k7xh61r,White House frustrated by Israel’s onslaught but sees few options,"As Israel’s ground invasion of Gaza escalates, the Biden administration finds itself in a precarious position: Administration officials say Israel’s counterattack against Hamas has been too severe, too costly in civilian casualties, and lacking a coherent endgame, but they are unable to exert significant influence on America’s closest ally in the Middle East to change its course.

U.S. efforts to get Israel to scale back its counterattack in response to the Oct. 7 killings by Hamas that left at least 1,400 Israelis dead have failed or fallen short. The Biden administration [urged Israel against a ground invasion,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/10/27/us-urging-israel-rethinkg-gaza-ground-invasion/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4) privately asked it to consider proportionality in its attacks, advocated a higher priority on avoiding civilian deaths, and [called for a humanitarian pause](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/10/27/gaza-israel-humanitarian-pause/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4) — only for Israeli officials to dismiss or reject all those suggestions.

That has left the Biden administration urgently seeking to temper anger in the Arab world by making clear, publicly and privately, that the United States is deeply distressed by the suffering in Gaza, a densely populated land strip of more than 2 million people, about half of whom are children. But there is little indication that Arab leaders are moved by these assurances, leaving the shape of the Middle East after the war — and the U.S. role in it — highly uncertain.

“It’s important for the administration to be loud in their concern for the humanitarian toll,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “I understand they don’t want to open up any public space between the United States and Israel. But if we all want to prevent another front from opening up and we want the Gulf states to be part of the reconstruction of Gaza, then we need to make as clear as possible that the United States is prioritizing reduction in civilian harm.”

Murphy recently issued a public statement declaring the current rate of civilian deaths “unacceptable” and urging Israel to shift course. “The administration has been pressing really hard privately,” Murphy said. “And I think they’ve got to be even louder publicly in their concerns about the civilian cost, even while they support Israel’s ability to continue to perpetuate the war.”

The White House declined to comment for this article. A spokesperson pointed to previous comments by national security adviser Jake Sullivan saying that Hamas’s use of Palestinian civilians as human shields does not lessen Israel’s responsibility to do everything possible to minimize civilian casualties.

> WASHINGTON - Sen. Bernie Sanders is preparing several resolutions that would stop more than $20 billion in U.S. arms sales to Israel, a longshot effort but the most substantive pushback yet from Congress over the devastation in Gaza ahead of the first year anniversary of the Israel-Hamas war.

> In a letter to Senate colleagues on Wednesday, Sanders said the U.S. cannot be &quot;Complicit in this humanitarian disaster.&quot; The action would force an eventual vote to block the arms sales to Israel, though majority passage is highly unlikely.

> As the war grinds toward a second year, and with the outcome of President Joe Biden&#039;s efforts to broker a cease-fire deal and hostage release uncertain, the resolutions from Sanders would seek to reign in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#039;s assault on Gaza.

On August 12, the IDF launched a massive barrage of West Beirut that became to be known as Black Thursday, resulting in the death of around 300 people.

Part of me wants to laugh, but the other part feels frustrated that there are Americans who think this way.

They are a vocal minority no doubt, but it's still concerning.

Because it's apparent that these people have no regard for important historical context, for the various factors that have all contributed, over the course of almost a century now, to the current conflict in Israel and consequently, across the middle East. 

To quote a meandering, arrogant, pseudo-intellectual conservative by the name of Ben Shapiro, ""facts don't care about your feelings.""

And that's all these types of comments are informed by, feelings.

You're ignoring or you are ignorant of a complicated history in the Middle East stretching back to the Balfour Declaration, the end of WW1, while some historians would argue, the late 19th century author/journalist, Theodore Herzl and his publication of ""Der Judenstaat.""

You're ignoring decades of geopolitics, world affairs and international relations, an Israeli/Palestinian conflict that has endured for almost a century now, the history of the Iranian revolution and all that's taken place since, a persistent conflict in Syria that has become a theater of war and hostilities for multiple nations across the globe, Middle East affairs in general, The United Nations involvement in some of these conflicts, Israel's more recent political history involving a strong man persona who has built a far right coalition in Israel that supports the collective punishment of the Palestinian people, as well as the gradual disposession of their land, and of course, America's own historical and ongoing foreign relationship with these nations and their political affairs.

Joe Biden is just a miniscule piece of the puzzle in relationship to this broader regional conflict

You're also ignoring the role that past administration's have played in either exacerbating these conflicts, in establishing or dismantling alliances, in making compromises and in some cases, failed attempts at peace efforts. 

Joe Biden did not start WWIII, in fact, conservatives seem to be more interested in encouraging such a war than anything else, so they can justify such a profoundly ignorant accusation that Joe Biden, equal parts dementia and criminal mastermind, is responsible for every conceivable global conflict. 

The actions that some of these social media foreign policy experts are vaguely advocating for, are not going to change the important fact that this regional conflict and its history are complicated. There is no catch-all solution, Joe Biden cannot flick his wrist and change its trajectory. 

It's also a multinational conflict that requires comprehensive considerations from our leaders before any action can be taken. 

Biden has communicated his support for Palestinian civilians and refugees, but the U.S. and Israel have been politically and strategically entangled for so long, that it's not as simple as just letting go of an important ally, or threatening to, on the off chance that it doesn't make things even more complicated. Netanyahu doesn't respond to aggressive maneuvers very diplomatically. Keep in mind also, that Netanyahu has benefitted throughout his political career from playing the strongman and sustaining a volatile and violent conflict in the region to remain in power. 

The U.S has leverage over the Israeli government, but it works both ways. Especially when Netanyahu has recently made a bigger political ally out of the Republican party, who cares little for the plight of Palestinians because many conservatives have simply lumped them in with all terrorists. Any effort from Biden to push hard against Netanyahu, will be met with an equal, but opposite reaction. And you better believe Republicans will capitalize off of it and make it part of their 2024 platform. But let's not go too far off tangent.

Biden is caught between a rock and a hard place. There's quite a few Conservatives who tend to become isolationists when it's beneficial for them, but blame Biden for both not doing enough or getting involved in most any capacity, there's no winning strategy here. The reality is, it's a series of historical, previous relations with countries like Israel and Iran in particular that put us in this foreign policy predicament, not the actions of a single current president. The U.S. and the middle East are separated by a vast expanse of ocean, but are regions tied together by these past alliances, conflicts, political and strategic relationships, ties that existed well before Biden took office. In other words, this dilemma, is likely one that any president would have had to face coming into this most recent term. This should be obvious enough, but for some, it isn't

I would suggest you incendiary critics inform yourselves and try, at the very least, to reflect on your motivations here, your prejudices and preconceptions, where you obtained them, and why you support these kinds of very short sighted, unnuanced, blatantly partisan and misinformed oversimplifications.

I would suggest it, yes, but I know such a suggestion would go over your head, or would fall on deaf ears. 

This is what I've come to expect of a vocal minority of agitators, contrarians and fanatics who are mindlessly adherent to one group, party, ideology or person, speaking in black and white terms, generalizations and preconceived ideas riddled with bias and prejudice, 

The most dangerous affliction plaguing our country right now is a disease named ignorance.","to all those, namely conservatives, who have already jumped to the conclusion that this means world war

supports the collective punishment of the palestinian people, as well as the gradual disposession of their land, and of course, america s own historical and ongoing foreign relationship with these nations and their political affairs. joe biden is just a miniscule piece of the puzzle in relationship to this broader regional conflict you are also ignoring the role that past administration s have played in either exacerbating these conflicts, in establishing or dismantling alliances, in making compromises and in some cases, failed attempts at peace efforts. joe biden did not start wwiii, in fact, conservatives seem to be more interested in encouraging such a war than anything else, so they can justify such a profoundly ignorant accusation that joe biden, equal parts dementia and criminal mastermind, is responsible for every conceivable global conflict. the actions that some of these social media foreign policy experts are vaguely advocating for, are not going to change the important fact that this regional conflict and its history are complicated. there is no catch all solution, joe biden cannot flick his wrist and change its trajectory. it is also a multinational conflict that requires comprehensive considerations from our leaders before any action can be taken. biden has communicated his support for palestinian civilians and refugees, but the you.s. and israel have been politically and strategically entangled for so long, that it is not as simple as just letting go of an important ally, or threatening to, on the off chance that it does not make things even more complicated. netanyahu does not respond to aggressive maneuvers very diplomatically. keep in mind also, that netanyahu has benefitted throughout his political career from playing the strongman and sustaining a volatile and violent conflict in the region to remain in power. the you.s has leverage over the israeli government, but it works both ways. especially when netanyahu has recently made a bigger political ally out of the republican party, who cares little for the plight of palestinians because many conservatives have simply lumped them in with all terrorists. any effort from biden to push hard against netanyahu, will be met with an equal, but opposite reaction. and you better believe republicans will capitalize off of it and make it part of their 2024 platform. but let us not go too far off tangent. biden is caught between a rock and a hard place. there is quite a few conservatives who tend to become isolationists when it is beneficial for them, but blame biden for both not doing enough or getting involved in most any capacity, there is no winning strategy here. the reality is, it is a series of historical, previous relations with countries like israel and iran in particular that put us in this foreign policy predicament, not the actions of a single current president. the you.s. and the middle east are separated by a vast expanse of ocean, but are regions tied together by these past alliances, conflicts, political and strategic relationships, ties that existed well before biden took office. in other words, this dilemma, is likely one that any president would have had to face coming into this most recent term. this should be obvious enough, but for some, it is not i would suggest you incendiary critics inform yourselves and try, at the very least, to reflect on your motivations here, your prejudices and preconceptions, where you obtained them, and why you support these kinds of very short sighted, unnuanced, blatantly partisan and misinformed oversimplifications. i would suggest it, yes, but i know such a suggestion would go over your head, or would fall on deaf ears. this is what i have come to expect of a vocal minority of agitators, contrarians and fanatics who are mindlessly adherent to one group, party, ideology or person, speaking in black and white terms, generalizations and preconceived ideas riddled with bias and prejudice, the most dangerous affliction plaguing our country right now is a disease named ignorance.","those, namely conservatives, already jumped conclusion means world war iii, else, important them, joe biden

Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), an independent who caucuses with Democrats, is forcing the politically tricky vote using a mechanism in U.S. foreign assistance law that requires the State Department to look into human rights practices of nations receiving U.S. aid. If passed, the resolution would require the department to produce a report within 30 days about any potential abuses and how U.S. weapons have been used in Gaza.

The resolution would not alter U.S. aid to Israel, but it is still facing opposition from the Biden administration and many Democrats, who have raised concerns about the message the vote would send.

“We are trying to call attention to some unpleasant realities that I think a lot of people would prefer not to deal with,” Sanders said in an interview.

2024-03-14 14:21:30,politics,Israel,1bembli,kuu6sr4,Schumer to call for ‘new election’ in Israel in scathing speech on Netanyahu,"Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) will call for the Israeli government to hold new elections in a speech warning that Israel risked becoming an international “pariah” under the leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing cabinet.

Schumer, the highest-ranking Jewish official in the United States and a staunch ally of Israel’s, is expected to say he thinks Israelis understand “better than anybody that Israel cannot hope to succeed as a pariah opposed by the rest of the world” and would choose better leaders if elections were held.

“I believe that holding a new election once the war starts to wind down would give Israelis an opportunity to express their vision for the postwar future,” Schumer will say in a speech on the Senate floor Thursday, according to prepared remarks that did not set an exact timeline for a new election.

The call marks the clearest signal to Israel yet that frustrations over Netanyahu’s handling of the war in Gaza are boiling over, and have reached the highest echelons of the U.S. government.

President Biden has frequently expressed frustration with Netanyahu in recent months, but has never publicly suggested that Israelis replace him. The prime minister is deeply unpopular at home after the Hamas attack of Oct. 7, and has tangled with U.S. officials over his hampering of humanitarian aid into Gaza and his stated desire to conduct a ground invasion in the crowded city of Rafah, which the United States thinks would lead to an unacceptably high level of civilian casualties. He’s also explicitly rejected U.S. entreaties to discuss a pathway to a two-state solution.

Not only was this a big fuck up by his government in getting caught by surprise, it's a result of Netanyahu's entire strategy around Hamas, as he [said](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-09/ty-article/.premium/another-concept-implodes-israel-cant-be-managed-by-a-criminal-defendant/0000018b-1382-d2fc-a59f-d39b5dbf0000):

> Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas

What happened was:

* Netanyahu was PM for 14 years, almost continuously, running on security as his main issue.  And the most recent government (before the unity government created after the attacks) was the most right wing in Israel's history.

* He is against a two state solution.  The main reason is not wanting to give up land/settlements on the West Bank.  Pumping up Hamas and undermining the Palestinian Authority keeps Palestinians divided, which undercuts any chance for a two state solution.  It also is a powerful argument against a Palestinian state - ""how can you ask us to leave the West Bank, look what happened when we left Gaza""

* He proceeded with normalization with Arab states without concessions (or with symbolic concessions) to the Palestinians, on the basis that the Palestinians can't interrupt that process (and the other Arab states don't love Hamas either, they wanna be respectable).

* Did other actions - more settlements, talk of annexing ""Area C"", embassy in Jerusalem, etc - that Israel/the US balked at on the basis of not wanting to piss the Palestinians off.

* Got closer to Russia, have a military industrial complex that does things like sell spyware to questionable foreign countries

* This was based on the idea that Hamas isn't *really* a big threat.  Israel has the blockade and the Iron Dome, they can (to use some buzzwords) ""shrink the conflict"" to the level of flare-ups every few years, Hamas fires some shitty rockets that don't kill anyone and Israel ""mows the grass"" in retaliation and cuts down Hamas's operational capabilities.  Enough to keep people scared, not enough to do real damage.

* Because the entire strategy is based on Hamas not being a big threat - you see what you want to see.

It's telling, by the way, that part of why Gaza was lightly defended was that troops were redeployed to the West Bank.  To defend settlers - in particular, the ""price tag"" extremists who are *looking for* a fight with Palestinians.  Microcosm of how Netanyahu was willing to trade off the danger of Hamas for territorial aggrandizement in the West Bank.","i think it is likely. he is already in a power sharing unity government with one of his rivals, and as bernie says, his poll numbers are way down. not only was this a big fuck up by his government in getting caught by surprise, it is a result of netanyahu s entire strategy around hamas, as he said anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a palestinian state has to support bolstering hamas and transferring money to hamas what happened was netanyahu was pm for 14 years, almost continuously, running on security as his main issue. and the most recent government before the unity government created after the attacks was the most right wing in israel s history. he is against a two state solution. the main reason is not wanting to give up land settlements on the west bank. pumping up hamas and undermining the palestinian authority keeps palestinians divided, which undercuts any chance for a two state solution. it also is a powerful argument against a palestinian state how can you ask us to leave the west bank, look what happened when we left gaza he proceeded with normalization with arab states without concessions or with symbolic concessions to the palestinians, on the basis that the palestinians cannot interrupt that process and the other arab states do not love hamas either, they want to be respectable . did other actions more settlements, talk of annexing area c , embassy in jerusalem, etc that israel the us balked at on the basis of not wanting to piss the palestinians off. got closer to russia, have a military industrial complex that does things like sell spyware to questionable foreign countries this was based on the idea that hamas is not really a big threat. israel has the blockade and the iron dome, they can to use some buzzwords shrink the conflict to the level of flare ups every few years, hamas fires some shitty rockets that do not kill anyone and israel mows the grass in retaliation and cuts down hamas s operational capabilities. enough to keep people scared, not enough to do real damage. because the entire strategy is based on hamas not being a big threat you see what you want to see. it is telling, by the way, that part of why gaza was lightly defended was that troops were redeployed to the west bank. to defend settlers in particular, the price tag extremists who are looking for a fight with palestinians. microcosm of how netanyahu was willing to trade off the danger of hamas for territorial aggrandizement in the west bank.","think likely. already power sharing unity government one rivals, bernie says, poll numbers way down. big fuck government getting caught surprise, result netanyahu entire strategy around hamas, said anyone wants thwart establishment palestinian state support bolstering hamas transferring money hamas happened netanyahu pm 14 years, almost continuously, running security main issue. recent government unity government created attacks right wing israel history. two state solution. main reason wanting give land settlements west bank. pumping hamas undermining palestinian authority keeps palestinians divided, undercuts chance two state solution. also powerful argument palestinian state ask us leave west bank, look happened left gaza proceeded normalization arab states without concessions symbolic concessions palestinians, basis palestinians cannot interrupt process arab states love hamas either, want respectable . actions settlements, talk annexing area c , embassy jerusalem, etc israel us balked basis wanting piss palestinians off. got closer russia, military industrial complex things like sell spyware questionable foreign countries based idea hamas really big threat. israel blockade iron dome, use buzzwords shrink conflict level flare ups every years, hamas fires shitty rockets kill anyone israel mows grass retaliation cuts hamas operational capabilities. enough keep people scared, enough real damage. entire strategy based hamas big threat see want see. telling, way, part gaza lightly defended troops redeployed west bank. defend settlers particular, price tag extremists looking fight palestinians. microcosm netanyahu willing trade danger hamas territorial aggrandizement west bank.",102,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/17oyylt/bernie_sanders_says_he_hopes_israel_rids_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/17oyylt/bernie_sanders_says_he_hopes_israel_rids_of/k82avz7,47.64727011494253,-0.8934,4.624972813284271

- Green Party candidate Jill Stein's running mate is Butch Ware, a history professor at UC Santa Barbara who focuses on ""race, religion and revolutionary thought.""   He also goes by Bilal Ware.    

- Apparently Ware's side gig is performing in a hip-hop group called ""Slum Prophecy.""   

- Slum Prophecy released an album in the summer of 2024 called ""Aqsa flood."" Which is a variation on Hamas' term for the October 7 attacks. (Al-Aqsa flood)   The album has songs titled ""Intifada"" and ""Kill shot (pick them off)"" , and the album art features an inverted red triangle, which is a common symbol used by pro-palestinian protesters. 

- Ware has shared social media posts with the slogan ""From the River to the Sea, Palestine will be free."" (Which is interpreted by many as calling for the destruction of Israel), as well as another post stating ""oppressors, whatever ""faith"" they ma claim, are doomed in this life and the next."" 

- Stein, who is herself Jewish, filmed a campaign video wearing a Keffiyeh. 

- David Duke has endorsed Jill Stein apparently, although Stein issued a press release disavowing the endorsement.

We still have a few weeks to hear sentencing, and he will undoubtedly appeal, which could last well into 2025.

But that's not what is important today.

This IS history. Polling saying voters are partisan and unmoved doesn't make it any less significant.

For starters, it's not a ""hush money"" case, as the media has latched onto. It's an *election interference* case, and these are *felonies.*

He worked to illegally cover up stories that could have easily swung the 2016 election, which was won by a few thousand votes in a few states, and could have altered the course of American history. It encapsulates everything about Trump and is the beginning to his criminal history saga regarding the Presidency.

It is hopefully only the beginning of his criminal accountability, and a necessary step forward for democracy, the rule of law, and us as a country.

He should have just said social media, because had he said “boomers and Facebook” instead of “Young folks and Tik Tok,” the internet would agree with him. 


Facebook, Twitter/X, Tik Tok, Reddit, all of them have algorithms to keep you enraged and engaged. Social media destroys any nuance to a situation and folks have to make absolute stands on one side or the other or be attacked mercilessly for it.

There are more than two positions here and it’s vital we keep saying that so we don’t turn into monsters with perceived righteousness. 

I stand with innocent people who are dying in this senseless war. Doesn’t matter where they were born, what religion they are. Doesn’t matter if they are young or old. Doesn’t matter how affluent or poor they are. I care about those trapped and being used as physical and political shields and weapons in this war. I hate that people’s deaths are being used to confuse, enrage, and radicalise the general public. 

I care about making sure people aren’t exterminated for simply existing, which both sides are being pushed to believe and support. 

I do not stand with Hamas. I do not stand with Netanyahu and the actions of his government. I think both of them are exacerbating this war and uninterested in peace. I think they are both dangerous to the security of the globe.

I do not replace *Hamas* with *Palestinian* or *Netanyahu* with *Israel.*

And I don’t conflate Israel with Judaism. 

That is wrong and I won’t do it.

You can be critical of Netanyahu and the actions of his government and not be anti-Semitic. You can say Hamas needs to be removed from power forever and power base destroyed and not be Islamaphobic.

- Biden administration says it is outraged and that it will talk to the Netanyahu administration.

- Israel officials will say that it was a mistake (even through it was 3 separate aid trucks in different regions of the de-militarized area and sure does look like a precision strike).

- Israel will say that there were targets in the area and somehow will justify the strikes.

- about 6 months will pass and they Israel administration will admit that no credible targets were in the area and it was an on purpose strike while at the same time attempting to justify striking clearly marked aid vehicles.

- no consequences will be placed on the Israeli administration and they will move on to the next atrocity. Rinse & repeat.

We saw this with the strikes to the Al Jezeera building, the hospitals, the aid stations, the flower massacre, the murder of journalists (American or otherwise).

2024-10-31 03:42:18,politics,Israel,1gg5jdf,lun5ylh,How can I vote for Kamala Harris if she supports Israel’s war? Here is my answer,"Here's my answer.

These ""protest votes"" against Harris are a tad unnerving considering the alternative.

In regards to the conflict in Israel, Harris has been vocal about a cease fire, she's openly expressed sympathy for innocent civilians in Gaza, she even refused to show up for Netanyahu's performance in Congress recently, performance being the key word there.

Donald Trump however, has an entirely different record as president, one that we can point to, and one that illustrates his own self-serving agenda and hardline stance on the war in Gaza. 

Trump cozied up to Netanyahu, and like he has with several contentious world leaders, Trump caved in to Bibi's political pressures.

Let me preface this by saying, I'm an American Jew myself, with Ashkenazi heritage no less, but I've spent time trying to understand this conflict and its complicated history from multiple historical perspectives. 

I don't take an indiscriminate stance on this war, my views are more nuanced, so I understand that not all Palestinians, nor are all Israelis a monolith. I understand that this conflict didn't begin on October 7th. I can sympathize with Palestinians who have suffered under military occupation, from collective punishment and the dispossession of their land. I can also sympathize with the plight of Jews who suffered from violent pogroms and almost lost their ethnic and national identity as a result of the Jewish diaspora.

I also understand that the two have been engaged in a cycle of violent conflict over land since the end of WWI after the signing of the Balfour Declaration. Some historians might argue it stretches back to the late nineteenth century as ""Zionism out of despair"" became a fledgling movement. Some argue that this conflict began in the mid-20th century, but that ignores decades of history leading up to that moment in time. 

Nevertheless, I can condemn both Hamas (and adjacent terror groups) and Netanyahu as it relates to the current state of the conflict in the region. Netanyahu has made it clear that a two state solution is no solution at all, while Hamas and its allies have also been unrelenting and undeniably share the blame in perpetuating this decades-long bloody conflict. A stalemate that has cost countless lives.

That being said, Trump's record indicates that not only is he willing to take an indiscriminate stance on this war that he likely knows next to nothing about, but he's willing to do it merely because he thinks its what's best for him politically.

Believe it or not, Trump is responsible for escalating multiple conflicts in the Middle East, some of which the U.S. military was involved. 

When it comes to his staunch Pro Israel record as president, Trump acknowledged Israel's controversial annexation of Golan Heights, and in December of 2017, formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and stated that the American embassy would be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

This act alone only heightened tensions in the region and weakened the U.S.'s capacity to act as a peace negotiator between Palestinians and Israelis. Such a move was a capitulation to Israeli leaders. While Trump, or more likely his advisors, understood the move was one that would garner them more support from their Christian voters who only see Jews as a means to a biblical end, quite literally mind you.

What's more, Trump's ""Middle East peace plan"" was poorly contrived, amateurish, and a step *away* from peace in the region. In fact, as foreign policy goes, it was more political theater than anything else as it also happened to coincide with his re-election campaign. This plan in particular also weakened our position as peace brokers in the region.

It's also important to note, that Donald Trump, by his very nature, doesn't have any specific foreign policy or political philosophy. His only philosophy is ""what's best for me?""

So his rhetoric can change at any moment depending on what's best for his political career. It should also be noted, that his rhetoric shifted temporarily after Netanyahu acknowledged Biden's win in 2020. Trump's penchant for holding grudges and his vindictive nature can also sometimes alter his public mood or his rhetoric. He's like a child really.

But that hasn't stopped him from labeling all pro Palestinian protestors as ""radicals.""

Speaking directly to the pro Palestinian movement, Trump reportedly said,

> “Well, if you get me elected, and you should really be doing this, if you get me reelected, we’re going to set that movement back 25 or 30 years,”

Trump may have offhandedly criticized Israel once or twice during this conflict, but he's quickly backpedaled with statements like, they ""have to have a victory.""

Because Trump also sees everything through a ratings lens, he's tastelessly claimed that Israel is ""absolutely losing the PR war.""

Trump hasn't laid out a plan for addressing the war in Israel if he wins a second term. But Trump's son-in-law and former nepokid, Middle East adviser, Jared Kushner, recently suggested that Gaza’s current borders can be redrawn in direct contradiction with current U.S. policy.

> “Gaza’s waterfront property could be very valuable,” Kushner said

It's likely that Trump's advisors have cautioned him against speaking out about the war, but that hasn't kept him from stigmatizing Palestinians and pro Palestinian protestors.

Also keep in mind Trump's history of bigoted remarks and actions taken against Muslims/the Arab world.

Before his presidency, Trump suggested multiple times that the U.S. has a ""Muslim problem."" He even called for the surveillance of Muslims and Muslim communities.

In 2015, he said he will ""look at"" closing mosques.

He defended warantless searches of American Muslims.

Trump once said he would “certainly implement” a database system to track Muslims and encouraged a Muslim registry

He called for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S.""

He's called Muslims ""sick people.""

Trump appointed Steve Bannon as his chief strategist. Bannon once claimed that “the Judeo-Christian west” is engaged in a “global war” against “jihadist Islamic fascism.”

Then there's Trump's first ""Muslim ban"", an executive order banning Syrian refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries.

Trump issued multiple iterations of his Muslim ban after that, including one that barred foreign nationals from eight countries.

Throughout his presidency, Trump reiterated the need for a Muslim ban and extreme vetting process and claimed that crime spikes were the result of ""radical islamic terror.""

While on Twitter, Trump also retweeted posts from an anti-muslim hate group.

And to add to this, let's not forget the recent ""rally"" in MSG that included a long list of speakers spouting extreme, xenophobic rhetoric.

All that being said, what I'm getting at here is, based on both of their records, who do you think is more likely to provide Palestinians with a greater measure of support and acknowledgement as president?","here is my answer. these protest votes against harris are a tad unnerving considering the alternative. in regards to the conflict in israel, harris has been vocal about a cease fire, she

I don’t think people understand what it means to walk up to our friends who have lost many loved ones in this war and tell them “don’t you understand, it can actually be worse?”. Have a fucking heart. What’s worse than them being killed indiscriminately and forcibly moved from their homes that they can’t return to? Nuking the place? Nuke it already then. You think they care if their death is slow or fast? Accelerate? Are you all serious? And even locally - you think the dems really have shown that they would protect us?

You want to bring the Arab vote, then just acknowledge that the dems can do better - you don’t have to say Trump will be worse. All people have to do is say - we are stuck in a shitty position because the Middle East is a fucked up place and our end goal is to stop this war (and yes that is different rhetoric than what is currently being said , which heavily implies the status quo is continuing). 

Arabs have felt betrayed by the democrats have been marginalised over and over again - shushed, educated on how “Trump is bad for us”, representatives who have said nothing walked out of rallies where fucking Liz Cheney was honoured (in the only state where the Arab vote matters). 

The dems have made it clear that they don’t give a crap about the Arab vote. Okay. So why all this drama? You either care and cater to the market you want or Let them be. Go pick up the voters republicans shat out of their party, the likes  of Liz Cheney instead who are apparently more worth your time.

While tensions between Bibi and the White House flare, Capitol Hill progressives are making the case for breaking up Israel and Ukraine aid, Semafor’s Kadia Goba reports.

In a new video set to be released this week, Rep. Jamaal Bowman says he’s opposed to the Senate’s $95 billion foreign aid bill, which combines support for the two countries, due to Israel’s conduct in Gaza.

“We cannot stand by and allow children to be bombed, to die of starvation, or to see their entire families wiped out,” he says, according to a partial transcript shared with Semafor. “That is why I cannot support the Senate’s aid bill, and why we need a standalone vote on Ukraine funding.”

Bowman isn’t alone. In recent weeks a progressive limelights including Reps. Pramila Jayapal, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Summer Lee have suggested they would not join a discharge petition to force a vote on the Senate bill, which is currently stalled in the House, over their concerns about Israel.

“I keep saying to the administration, give us a standalone on Ukraine,” Rep. Delia Ramirez, Ill., told Semafor last week.

Democrats have generally resisted the idea of separating the aid packages, which Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has floated repeatedly. But there is now clearly a left-right coalition that favors it.

I’m voting for Harris because her economic plans will benefit all of us. 

I’m voting for Harris because, as a woman, I’m not ready to become a 2nd class citizen

2024-01-31 21:04:53,politics,Palestine,1afsmys,koc66a5,US ‘could recognise Palestine’ after war in Gaza,"**From The Telegraph:**

The United States could recognise a Palestinian state after the war in Gaza, according to reports suggesting the State Department is considering a shift in policy.

Antony Blinken, America’s top diplomat, has commissioned the State Department to review potential options for US and international recognition of a Palestinian state, Axios reported.

It comes after Lord Cameron revealed that Britain is weighing up whether to formally recognise Palestine as a state.

The Foreign Secretary said Britain had a “responsibility” to work towards a two-state solution, adding: “We with allies will look at the issue of recognising a Palestinian state, including at the United Nations.”

Matt Miller, a spokesman for the State Department, said the Biden administration has not shifted its policy on the issue, but declined to comment on reports of a review.

“We have been quite clear publicly that we support the establishment of an independent Palestinian state … with security guarantees for Israel,” he said. “That’s been the policy of the United States for some time.”

However, he continued: “We look at any number of options. That’s part of the normal planning process. The vast majority of options never usually get implemented.”

Washington has opposed recognition of a Palestinian state for decades, arguing that it should only be achieved through negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.

But a senior official told Axios that the administration’s push to find a diplomatic way out of Israel’s war in Gaza has required a re-examination of “old US paradigms and policies”.

The move towards normalising ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia is seen by the White House as a pathway to recognition of a Palestinian state, according to Axios.

She must break with Biden on Israel and Palestine,">[I resigned because of Joe Biden’s disastrous policy on Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza), providing the financial and diplomatic support for the Israeli military to massacre, starve and forcibly expel countless Palestinians in Gaza. As a staffer in the administration, I heard reports that Harris and her staff pushed the US president to adopt a policy on Gaza that was both more humane and in alignment with international law, but were rebuffed. I saw the Harris I moved to Iowa for in her speech in Selma, becoming the first senior administration official calling for a ceasefire, even as I was disappointed that it was only for six weeks. This was reportedly an effort by Biden’s team to water down her speech. It is shameful that Biden refused to listen to Harris – or the majority of Americans for that matter. Now that Biden has stepped aside, she has the opportunity to chart her own path on Israel and Palestine.
>
>
>
>For months, the majority of Democrats and Americans, including American Jews, have supported a lasting ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. Harris must make clear that she supports using the US government’s leverage to end the bloodshed and reunite families. One clear way that she can do so is by supporting an arms embargo on offensive weapons for the Israeli military – a policy floated by Biden before he ultimately backtracked and greenlit Israel’s devastating ground invasion of Rafah.
>
>
>
>Once Israel’s brutal assault on Gaza ends, a President Harris could begin a new era in which the US government uses commonsense diplomatic and financial pressure to bring about a long-term political solution that would end Israel’s system of apartheid over Palestinians and guarantee equality, justice and safety for Palestinians and Israelis alike.

>By setting herself apart from Biden’s failed policy, Harris has the opportunity to rebuild a coalition to defeat Trump that would include progressives, young people and Arab Americans among others.

>More than 700,000 Democrats voted uncommitted during the primary in protest of Biden’s support for Israel’s war on Gaza. They are a crucial part of the coalition needed for Democrats to win swing states like Michigan, Georgia and Minnesota. The policies these voters are demanding are broadly popular among Democrats and Americans writ large. [Even a majority of my own community, American Jews, support conditioning arms shipments to Israel](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/article-804548).

>Harris has at times fallen short of her promise to deliver justice. As a prosecutor, she put nonviolent drug users behind bars and she prosecuted parents for their children’s absence from school. She has also maintained close ties with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), the rightwing lobby primarily funded by Republican donors that has endorsed election-deniers and anti-abortion extremists. If Harris is serious about “putting justice on the ballot”, she must commit to ending mass incarceration and overzealous prosecution in this country and reject Aipac’s rightwing agenda as president. If she does both, she has the opportunity to turn out record numbers of voters to enable her to defeat Trump in November.

Unveiled by the ultra-right Heritage Foundation on the one-year anniversary of Israel launching its genocidal campaign against the people of Gaza, Project Esther claims to present a “national strategy to combat antisemitism.”

> The document claims that anti-Zionism and pro-peace sentiments are always and in every case equivalent to antisemitism. It calls for infiltrating, surveilling, and destroying groups it identifies as being affiliated with an alleged “global Hamas support network.”

> Targeted organizations include, but are not limited to: Students for Justice in Palestine, American Muslims for Palestine, Jewish Voice for Peace, Alliance for Global Justice, the Tides Foundation, and even the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. It bizarrely alleges that these groups’ motivations and understanding of history come “straight from the pages” of the Communist Manifesto.

> Neither the Klan nor neo-Nazis are identified as possible targets in the project outline, as if antisemitism does not exist among the network of white supremacist organizations that support MAGA.

This dynamic is antidemocratic on its own terms and obviously dripping with arrogance from party elites, but it also has now sunk the party. Virtually nobody of consequence within the party felt comfortable speaking out against Biden running again. Through the party's behind the scenes maneuvering to neutralize any real primary challengers, voters were stripped of the opportunity to give voice to what polls made clear, which is that Democratic voters across the country preferred he not run again.

Progressives, activists, and other voters across the Dem party have every right to feel we've been betrayed, silenced, and treated like babies by the party machine. Perhaps all along it was rank and file voters who were smarter than Biden's inner circle. It was us who recognized Biden's old age and cognitive deficiencies made him unfit to serve into his mid-80's. It was his team that stubbornly pushed forward while going to great lengths to hide him from the public.

Everyone involved in the Dem party machine should be ashamed. While they are all wealthy enough to live prosperously during and after Trump's 2nd term, I hope their knowledge that their legacies are forever tarnished eats at them for the remainder of their lives. It is unconscionable what they've done, purely out of their own arrogance and distrust of the very Americans they claim to work on behalf of.","it is true that the democratic party machine has long set the terms of debate as follows any criticism of their decision making is, in effect, pro trump, and so even good faith criticism of the party or its leading candidates hillary in 2016, and then biden in 2020 and 2024 is inherently problematic and morally reprehensible. this dynamic is antidemocratic on its own terms and obviously dripping with arrogance from party elites, but it also has now sunk the party. virtually nobody of consequence within the party felt comfortable speaking out against biden running again. through the party s behind the scenes maneuvering to neutralize any real primary challengers, voters were stripped of the opportunity to give voice to what polls made clear, which is that democratic voters across the country preferred he not run again. progressives, activists, and other voters across the dem party have every right to feel we have been betrayed, silenced, and treated like babies by the party machine. perhaps all along it was rank and file voters who were smarter than biden s inner circle. it was us who recognized biden s old age and cognitive deficiencies made him unfit to serve into his mid 80 s. it was his team that stubbornly pushed forward while going to great lengths to hide him from the public. everyone involved in the dem party machine should be ashamed. while they are all wealthy enough to live prosperously during and after trump s 2nd term, i hope their knowledge that their legacies are forever tarnished eats at them for the remainder of their lives. it is unconscionable what they have done, purely out of their own arrogance and distrust of the very americans they claim to work on behalf of.","true democratic party machine long set terms debate follows criticism decision making is, effect, pro trump, even good faith criticism party leading candidates hillary 2016, biden 2020 2024 inherently problematic morally reprehensible. dynamic antidemocratic terms obviously dripping arrogance party elites, also sunk party. virtually nobody consequence within party felt comfortable speaking biden running again. party behind scenes maneuvering neutralize real primary challengers, voters stripped opportunity give voice polls made clear, democratic voters across country preferred run again. progressives, activists, voters across dem party every right feel betrayed, silenced, treated like babies party machine. perhaps along rank file voters smarter biden inner circle. us recognized biden old age cognitive deficiencies made unfit serve mid 80 s. team stubbornly pushed forward going great lengths hide public. everyone involved dem party machine ashamed. wealthy enough live prosperously trump 2nd term, hope knowledge legacies forever tarnished eats remainder lives. unconscionable done, purely arrogance distrust americans claim work behalf of.",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1dvzgdy/propalestine_democrats_were_here_already_its_not/,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1dvzgdy/propalestine_democrats_were_here_already_its_not/lbr16bb,48.13807012100527,0.9881,1.9459101490553132

“Parroted Hitler” is good because it’s correct. It can stay. But this orange clown is a straight up, mask off fascist right now. Moreso than before. He was still learning to be a fascist in 2016. He ran into a whole bunch of unexpected checks and balances in his administration (possibly because he’s learning from a world leader that doesn’t HAVE any checks and balances). So now he wants to do away with those.

He wants to put me in a camp. And I’m just some guy. I donno if he’d be able to do it if he got a second term, but I know he’d try to work his way there.

He wants to put you in a camp too.

No more politics as sports. This is not helpful at all. Situation critical, because the American people are going to forget about how bad it was before if it’s treated as normal. And things will be worse if he gets in again.

Also? If he gets in again? That won’t be his last term. Guaranteed.

But over 9 million homes, schools, daycares, and businesses receive their water through a lead pipe, putting people at risk of lead exposure. Lead is a neurotoxin that can irreversibly harm brain development in children, and it can also accumulate in the bones and teeth, damage the kidneys, and interfere with the production of red blood cells needed to carry oxygen. Due to decades of inequitable infrastructure development and underinvestment, lead poisoning disproportionately affects low-income communities and communities of color. There is no safe level of exposure to lead. That is why the President made a **commitment to replace every lead pipe in the country within a decade** and coordinated a whole of government effort to deploy resources and leverage every tool across federal, state and local government to address lead hazards through the Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan. 

>As part of this unprecedented commitment, President Biden is traveling today to Wilmington, North Carolina, to announce **$3 billion through his Investing in America agenda to replace toxic lead pipes.** This investment, administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is part of the historic $15 billion in dedicated funding for lead pipe replacement provided by the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Today’s announcement delivers funding to every state and U.S. territory to help address lead in drinking water while creating good-paying jobs, many of them union jobs. In addition, this program funding is part of the President’s Justice40 Initiative, which set a goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities, and is helping address the inequities of lead exposure.

>Additionally, to further reduce lead exposure, **the Department of Housing and Urban Development is announcing today nearly $90 million** in available funding to reduce residential health hazards in public housing, including lead-based paint hazards, carbon monoxide, mold, radon, fire safety, and asbestos, advancing the President’s Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan.

>Today’s announcement from the EPA builds on more than $20 billion in water infrastructure investments that state and local governments have made through the President’s American Rescue Plan. North Carolina has invested close to $2 billion from the American Rescue Plan in more than 800 clean water, wastewater, and stormwater projects across the state and is using another $150 million to test for and remove lead hazards in every school and child care center across the state, a historic effort to remove lead from North Carolina schools.

From one of the preeminent neocons, David Frum.  The fact that he is a Biden cheerleader is not the win Democrats think it is.  It shows the absolute degradation of the Democratic Party and how comically far Right the Overton Window is.

First, Israel struck Iran.  ""Israel should count score and strike back against Iran when the time is right"" is absolute nonsense.  Israel is the aggressor, and Iran has been the MORE reasonable party throughout all of this.  More reasonable than Israel OR Joe Biden.  Donald Trump tore up the Iran Deal because he hated everything Obama did.  What is Biden's excuse for not getting back into that deal 3 years later?  There isn't one.  Pure 1990's-era Zionist lunacy and pure stubbornness.

It is actively a terrible, terrible thing that we are helping fund our ""ally"" Israel as they starve and massacre innocent people as collective punishment for an attack that their general brutal treatment of Gazans had specifically propelled.  The fact that they ALSO want a world war--want to start one that US dollars and troops will have to fight--should immediately mean that we stop all funding to these rogue ungrateful f\*cking psychopaths, not that we leap into rebuilding their forces so that they can go and attack Iran again.  So that they can go and shoot sobbing people who are looking for their dead children's remains in the rubble in Gaza.

Frum has wanted a regional Middle East war for decades.  He has never ever cared about how many people will die, how close we could be to nuclear conflict, or how many trillions of dollars we throw into various holes in the world so we can protect corporate oil and defense interests.  Him championing the Great Work of Joe Biden for continuing to fund war crimes and catastrophic offensive provocations is almost literally sickening.  And, BTW, those war crimes will also likely cost Biden the slim chance he still has to be reelected.  So imagine a World War AND Trump, while you're smiling about how David Frum ""nailed Republicans"" for being obstructionist.

Duh. Have you not seen the dems platform? When Progressives wanted to called out the settlements Biden forced them to take it out.

2024-04-03 14:51:07,politics,Palestine,1butlwh,kxuzond,Palestinian American doctor walks out of Biden meeting in protest,"**Palestinian-American believe, wrongly, that America has control over Israel. Nothing could be further from the truth.**

America does have an interest in the region, mainly to prevent the place blowing up in a huge war and, possibly, in a nuclear war.

Only idiots ignore that Israel has nuclear weapons, despite America's and Europe's best efforts to prevent Israel from developing those weapons. Israel does not admit it has those weapons but we all know it does.

**Many countries have vowed to destroy Israel**

But what most people don't know is that Israel has a doom's day policy that if it ever gets invaded or is nearing destruction, it will obliterate most of the Middle East in a nuclear firestorm. That policy is called the [Samson Option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Option).

America's interest in the region is simple; peace at all cost in order to create political stability necessary for commerce in the most oil rich area on Earth.

Also, America's interest in Israel is that it wants to prevent Israel from selling nuclear weapons technology to other countries that might eventually become hostile towards the US. 

Lastly, America wants to avoid a nuclear exchange where Israel would, in self-defense, destroy much of the Middle East.

Those are why America is supporting Israel, for stability, to prevent a proliferation of nuclear weapons through the world and to avoid a nuclear war.

**Why America sells weapons to Israel?**

Because if America doesn't, the French, the Chinese or the Russians will or Israel will make its own weapons, just like Israel copied the French Mirage to produce the [Kfir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAI_Kfir) or copied the F-16 to make the [Lavi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAI_Lavi). Israel also makes its own tanks, the [Merkava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkava) and its own missile systems.

**Why America supports Israel?**

Because having America threaten all the countries that would like to destroy Israel is the best way to avoid a nuclear conflict in the region, knowing that Israel's dooms day policy is to launch all of its nukes on the capital cities of its enemies.

**Basically that's the deal, either America ensures Israel's security or Israel gets invaded/destroyed and the whole Middle East becomes a radioactive wasteland.**

The actions of America are actually saving Arab lives.

**The worst thing that could happen to the Middle East is America deciding it no longer cares, remove its protection from Israel and allowing a war to start and possibly Israel launching nukes in desperation.**","palestinian american believe, wrongly, that america has control over israel. nothing could be further from the truth. america does have an interest in the region, mainly to prevent the place blowing up in a huge war and, possibly, in a nuclear war. only idiots ignore that israel has nuclear weapons, despite america s and europe s best efforts to prevent israel from developing those weapons. israel does not admit it has those weapons but we all know it does. many countries have vowed to destroy israel but what most people do not know is that israel has a doom s day policy that if it ever gets invaded or is nearing destruction, it will obliterate most of the middle east in a nuclear firestorm. that policy is called the samson option america s interest in the region is simple peace at all cost in order to create political stability necessary for commerce in the most oil rich area on earth. also, america s interest in israel is that it wants to prevent israel from selling nuclear weapons technology to other countries that might eventually become hostile towards the us. lastly, america wants to avoid a nuclear exchange where israel would, in self defense, destroy much of the middle east. those are why america is supporting israel, for stability, to prevent a proliferation of nuclear weapons through the world and to avoid a nuclear war. why america sells weapons to israel? because if america does not, the french, the chinese or the russians will or israel will make its own weapons, just like israel copied the french mirage to produce the kfir or copied the f 16 to make the lavi israel also makes its own tanks, the merkava and its own missile systems. why america supports israel? because having america threaten all the countries that would like to destroy israel is the best way to avoid a nuclear conflict in the region, knowing that israel s dooms day policy is to launch all of its nukes on the capital cities of its enemies. basically that is the deal, either america ensures israel s security or israel gets invaded destroyed and the whole middle east becomes a radioactive wasteland. the actions of america are actually saving arab lives. the worst thing that could happen to the middle east is america deciding it no longer cares, remove its protection from israel and allowing a war to start and possibly israel launching nukes in desperation.","palestinian american believe, wrongly, america control israel. nothing could truth. america interest region, mainly prevent place blowing huge war and, possibly, nuclear war. idiots ignore israel nuclear weapons, despite america europe best efforts prevent israel developing weapons. israel admit weapons know does. many countries vowed destroy israel people know israel doom day policy ever gets invaded nearing destruction, obliterate middle east nuclear firestorm. policy called samson option america interest region simple peace cost order create political stability necessary commerce oil rich area earth. also, america interest israel wants prevent israel selling nuclear weapons technology countries might eventually become hostile towards us. lastly, america wants avoid nuclear exchange israel would, self defense, destroy much middle east. america supporting israel, stability, prevent proliferation nuclear weapons world avoid nuclear war. america sells weapons israel? america not, french, chinese russians israel make weapons, like israel copied french mirage produce kfir copied f 16 make lavi israel also makes tanks, merkava missile systems. america supports israel? america threaten countries would like destroy israel best way avoid nuclear conflict region, knowing israel dooms day policy launch nukes capital cities enemies. basically deal, either america ensures israel security israel gets invaded destroyed whole middle east becomes radioactive wasteland. actions america actually saving arab lives. worst thing could happen middle east america deciding longer cares, remove protection israel allowing war start possibly israel launching nukes desperation.",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1butlwh/palestinian_american_doctor_walks_out_of_biden/,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1butlwh/palestinian_american_doctor_walks_out_of_biden/kxuzond,49.478012564249,-0.9962,1.791759469228055

It's also important to note that he is still publicly calling for a ceasefire and a 2 state solution in Gaza. To hear the press state it, you wouldn't believe he stands for either thing.

The problem is that the issue is so tangled now that there isn't a clear ""correct"" side to choose. Both sides have committed awful acts, and both sides have suffered.

So what's it going to be? Who is going to cede territory to the other? I'm pretty fucking sure one side has the ability to make that decision today, and the other will have no other option but to fight for their claim.","it was way easier to say hey, cut that out when there was not several more decades of ongoing conflict and horrible terrorist acts that kill civilians, sparking months long conflicts. the problem is that the issue is so tangled now that there is not a clear correct side to choose. both sides have committed awful acts, and both sides have suffered. the reality is that this should have been ironed out before creating the nation of israel. because of that failure, we have a big fucking mess that cannot and will not ever end without some level of diaspora. so what is it going to be? who is going to cede territory to the other? i am pretty fucking sure one side has the ability to make that decision today, and the other will have no other option but to fight for their claim.","way easier say hey, cut several decades ongoing conflict horrible terrorist acts kill civilians, sparking months long conflicts. problem issue tangled clear correct side choose. sides committed awful acts, sides suffered. reality ironed creating nation israel. failure, big fucking mess cannot ever end without level diaspora. going be? going cede territory other? pretty fucking sure one side ability make decision today, option fight claim.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/17reo5e/jimmy_carter_stood_up_for_palestinians_why_wont/,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/17reo5e/jimmy_carter_stood_up_for_palestinians_why_wont/k8iejui,35.366379310344826,-0.946,1.0986122886681098

Thousands of protesters gathered in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday to demonstrate against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address before a joint session of Congress.

Netanyahu’s trip to the Capitol has been controversial since House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) first announced his plans to invite the prime minister in May. Several lawmakers declined to attend the joint session given the brutality of the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, and the ongoing investigations into human rights violations committed by the Israeli military in their ongoing siege against Gaza.

Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), the most vocally pro-Palestine member of Congress, did attend Netanyahu’s speech. She wore a Palestinian pin and scarf, and held up a “WAR CRIMINAL” sign as Netanyahu spoke.

2024-07-25 16:04:57,politics,Palestine,1ebyk71,lew1tl4,'Monstrous': Hear From An Israeli Hostage’s Relative Arrested During Netanyahu’s Speech To Congress,"> Mor, an Israeli citizen, said he sees the U.S. as the “greatest hope” for the release of his uncle. But as he watched Netanyahu on Wednesday deliver remarks to a joint session of Congress ― from his place in one of the galleries for guests, a seat he got via an invitation from Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) ― Mor couldn’t help himself. During one of the multiple standing ovations Netanyahu received, Mor stood up and yelled into the House of Representatives chamber three times: “1,400 deaths!”

> It was a reference to the initial Israeli estimate of deaths on Oct. 7., which has since been revised to around 1,200.

> “It was on [Netanyahu’s] watch,” Mor told HuffPost, that people like his cousin, Munder’s son, were slaughtered.

> “It’s mind-boggling” to see U.S. legislators applaud Netanyahu, he added, in his first interview since his arrest. “I know half of the people don’t believe a word he says, but still there’s this equation ― that we must fight ― that if you criticize Netanyahu, then you’re helping the antisemites.”

> “I think it’s bullshit: You have to oppose Netanyahu,” Mor continued. “It’s not that you’re an antisemite — you’re truthful.”

> Mor said he was approached by an usher after his third outburst, then arrested by police and brought a holding area, before being driven to a police station. He and five other relatives of Israeli hostages who also attended the speech have been charged under a statute in District of Columbia law that makes it illegal “knowingly, with force and violence, to enter or to remain upon the floor of either House of the Congress,” a spokesperson for the U.S. Capitol Police, Brianna Burch, told HuffPost.

> Mor said he was approached by an usher after his third outburst, then arrested by U.S. Capitol Police and brought to a holding area, before being driven to a police station. He and five other relatives of Israeli hostages ― who also attended the speech, and during it, unveiled protest T-shirts ― have been charged under a statute in District of Columbia law that makes it illegal “knowingly, with force and violence, to enter or to remain upon the floor of either House of the Congress,” a spokesperson for the U.S. Capitol Police, Brianna Burch, told HuffPost.

> The five others issued a joint statement earlier Wednesday evening, stating: “Some of us wore a T-shirt calling on our Prime Minister to finally seal that deal, because this is his responsibility. And for that perceived offense, we were removed from the visitors’ gallery. No matter what, we will continue to fight for those who cannot: our family members being held captive in Gaza.”

> On Tuesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) had threatened people who disrupted the Netanyahu speech with prosecution.

> Relatives of those taken hostage have for months criticized Netanyahu for continuing fighting in the Gaza Strip ― Hamas’ base ― rather than cutting a ceasefire deal to let the captives come home.

> In November, the U.S. helped orchestrate a brief truce and prisoner exchange between Hamas and Israel, freeing dozens of hostages, including Mor’s aunt, cousin and nephew. Mor believes President Joe Biden’s help was “instrumental” in their release. Netanyahu’s government argues it is still prioritizing the freedom of the hostages, including through military raids to free specific groups of them.

> Mor isn’t sure what to do now, he said: He’s been given a court date for Aug. 14 but he is scheduled to head back to Israel on Aug. 2.

> He said it was “ludicrous” that he was arrested during the speech and wants to shift the focus back to Netanyahu. The prime minister brought the families of several hostages to Washington with him, a choice Mor described as “monstrous.”

> “Only an extremely cynical person could even think about doing such a thing,” Mor told HuffPost.

> Omar issued a statement on Mor’s arrest Wednesday night, saying: “He could not stand to listen to his harmful rhetoric. As a family member of an Israeli hostage, he has experienced the agonizing pain of Netanyahu’s failure to bring the hostages home and inability to make a deal. His bravery to call out Netanyahu’s genocide mirrors the sentiment shared by millions of Americans who want to see a permanent ceasefire and an end to this genocide funded by our tax dollars.”

> For now, Mor is determined to keep the focus on Netanyahu and to undercut the prime minister’s attempt to project the impression that he’s respected abroad, especially by the U.S., Israel’s closest ally.

> “He’s not answering the people he’s responsible for. He sees himself as an American statesman and we can see the result: It’s a complete betrayal of his own citizens,” Mor argued.","mor, an israeli citizen, said he sees the you.s. as the greatest hope for the release of his uncle. but as he watched netanyahu on wednesday deliver remarks to a joint session of congress from his place in one of the galleries for guests, a seat he got via an invitation from rep. ilhan omar d minn. mor could not help himself. during one of the multiple standing ovations netanyahu received, mor stood up and yelled into the house of representatives chamber three times 1,400 deaths!

It was interesting to read about the perspectives of some of these creators regarding their experiences and their content from this year's DNC. It's pretty heartening to see a new generation becoming involved in the political discourse, and having communicators or content creators who can provide information and context in a format they use is incredibly useful.

2024-09-23 12:14:47,politics,Palestine,1fniw9o,loii9oa,Has Michael Regan’s EPA Kept Its Promises?,"EPA Administrator Michael Regan became the face of the Biden administration’s commitment to environmental racial justice—and the target of politicians who seek to hobble the agency, Vann R. Newkirk II reports. [https://theatln.tc/sKSE4YKc](https://theatln.tc/sKSE4YKc)

Regan, the EPA’s second Black administrator, focused his agency on addressing environmental racism. Black, Indigenous, Latino, and low-income communities are far more likely to experience environmental problems than people in high-income, majority-white areas. Black people, for instance, suffer 54 percent more pollution from industrial facilities than other Americans, contributing to child-asthma rates that are about twice as high as those of white children. Before the Biden administration, the EPA had been a clear failure in its capacity as a civil-rights watchdog; a 2015 analysis found that the EPA’s Office of Civil Rights had not made a single formal finding of discrimination—ever.

Discrimination can be hard to establish if one must prove intent. To combat this, the EPA’s investigations relied on “disparate-impact theory,” which accounts for the racial impact of specific policy decisions, regardless of whether outright racial bigotry is evident. Disparate-impact theory has been a powerful tool for enforcing civil-rights law, but it’s also controversial.

Among GOP lawmakers, the EPA’s investigations “helped earn the agency a reputation for being ‘woke.’ And, undoubtedly, it was easier to pin that reputation on a Black man,” Newkirk writes. Many Republican attorneys general have found in the EPA and Regan a handy foil for advancing a broader agenda, and hope to use the courts to end all federal civil-rights enforcement based on disparate impact.

Eventually figuring that any case involving disparate impact would be challenged in court—and that an adverse ruling could jeopardize the future of the idea for the whole government—the EPA backed away from some of its investigations. Regan can claim concrete improvements for disadvantaged communities during his tenure. But, Newkirk continues, the EPA will likely finish Joe Biden’s term with a civil-rights-adjudication record “little better than the ones under his predecessors.”

MAGA Inc., the Donald Trump-aligned Super PAC, joined TikTok on Wednesday, marking the first group affiliated with Trump to do so.

The independent super PAC kicked off its TikTok page with several videos, including one that slammed Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s record of supporting Democrats and going after Republicans, describing him as “a radical leftist.” Another video talked about Trump’s tax cuts and asked viewers whether they could “afford four more years of Joe Biden.” The latest social media account will be used to spread campaign messages, rapid response, and other pro-Trump content.

“There’s millions of voters on TikTok, and @MAGA will deliver President Donald J. Trump’s pro-freedom, pro-America agenda every day with the facts and stories that matter,” Taylor Budowich, CEO of MAGA Inc., said in a statement. “We aren’t trying to set policy, we are trying to win an election.”

Budowich also offered up some insight as to why the organization decided to join TikTok, despite Republican condemnations of the platform’s ties to China: He said they wouldn’t “cede any platform to Joe Biden and the Democrats,” (the Biden campaign launched its own TikTok account in February) and promised that Trump’s “America First agenda will be brought to every corner of the internet.” Fox News first reported the news.
