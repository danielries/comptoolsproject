The purpose of adding this statement into the discussion (As opposed to just ""Free Palestine"") is to make it explicitly clear that the person speaking wishes to completely eliminate the entire nation of Israel, not simply free the Gaza strip, the West Bank, or establish some other sort of two-state solution.

This entire conflict right now happened what it did because Israel and Saudi Arabia were normalizing relationships. October 7th was done to deliberately sabotage that

The older generation of politicians in Saudi value Palestine and some of the people in Saudi Arabia value it, but they're not exactly a democracy 

Anything Saudi Arabia can do to make it easier to have strong ties to Israel it will 

It's also worth noting most countries only operate based off of their current and future interests (some of the West is an exception) and more or less almost every nation in the world's interests line up with Israel which is why a lot of governments actions don't match their condemnation

The Yemen-based rebel group targeted the southern port city of Eilat with the new missile on Monday. Air raid sirens sounded in Israel in response to the attack, though no damage or injuries were reported.

The missile appears to be similar to one Iran unveiled earlier this year.

Footage released on Wednesday night claimed to show the launch of the Palestine, its warhead painted in the chequered pattern of a Palestinian keffiyeh scarf.

Experts say it is a precision-guided solid-fuel missile, more advanced than the liquid propellant missiles without guidance that the Houthis have been using until now.

2024-11-03 10:31:56,worldnews,Palestine,1giekw2,lv5pkgn,Palestine Action carries out multi-location vandalism to mark Balfour Declaration signing,"Geez, you know the Balfour Declaration was unfair for the Palestinians, but it was nowhere near an ethnic cleansing. A small portion of land was taken without consultation with the locals and without any agreement with them, but they still had a majority of their land to themselves. And not only that but the newly formed state of Israel seemed open to having discussions with their neighbours and maybe finding a peaceful solution. But no, instead their neighbors decided violence would be their only answer to the situation, and in doing so they lost more land and power all while thousands of people lost their lives, mostly their own. Would they learn? Only a few of them, Jordan and Egypt got smart about it and made peace, as well as some other Muslim states further away. But Palestine and Lebanon just decided their one solution, a failing solution, would be the only idea they entertained and in doing so continued to lose more and more land and power. And as a result Israel got comfortable with what they had taken and people began the lives of several generations on these lands making it harder and harder to leave them. So as a result Israel became less lenient with what they were willing to give back to these neighbouring states.

Now they have next to nothing and they are still using a strategy that has never won them an inch of land back. Protests like this and the violence from the people fighting in that area will never bring any positive results for the Palestinians. Peaceful negotiations are the only way. And unfortunately because of their past actions any chance to take back their original lands will take at least as long as it did to lose them all, and likely much longer.

I just don't get why they can't come to the table with Israel and negotiate peacefully. Israel has shown a willingness to give back much of the land in the past, and even if they can't get everything they want right now, they could get *something*, and that would be a stepping stone to securing more in the future.",140,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1giekw2/palestine_action_carries_out_multilocation/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1giekw2/palestine_action_carries_out_multilocation/lv5pkgn

Over the last year, Hezbollah has fired thousands of missiles into Israel, specifically at civilian targets.

Israel has had most of the area evacuated for months, but they have still managed to damage a lot of places, and even hit people, such as the 12 kids at the school they hit.

Also remember, Hezbollah isn't Israel. Hezbollah doesn't announce their targets, doesn't send text messages or drop fliers. Hezbollah does not provide planned evacuation routes or bring in aid trucks to the Israelis they hit. Hezbollah certainly doesn't provide medical care to Israeli civilians they accidentally hit. Israel does *all of those things* if they have to hit a civilian area.

The silly thing is that these groups attacking Israel while they feel they are preoccupied with other enemies are just giving Israel more motivation and excuses to keep attacking in the name of defense.

- Hamas is by all accounts a ruthlessly brutal organisation of religious zealots that has held complete control over Gaza for decades 
- UNWRA has been operating from Gaza during that period with humongous levels of funding, employing 1000s and taking responsibility for education and schooling of 100s of thousands of Palestinian youth amongst [others ](https://www.unrwa.org/what-we-do)
- What brutal dictatorship would let this type of organisation ever remain remotely independent?

It would have made no sense whatsoever for UNWRA operations within Gaza to be anything else than what they are : an accessory to Hamas' policies, and to employ Hamas sympathisers and members only. No dictatorship would have it any other way. No genocidal zealot will ever oustsource education to  a neutral third party.

That this is even disputed, that some people would lend a sympathetic ear to UNWRA' s denials is only further demonstration of how fucked up the situation is, when suspension of belief, denial of the most obvious reality become the norm.

The concept of [UNWRA neutrality ](https://www.unrwa.org/neutrality) in a place like Gaza (their pillars are neutrality , impartiality and independence!) is an insult to intelligence. The denials of their hierarchy only serves to demonstrate that, far from being neutral they're in cahoots with that abhorrent criminal regime. They should be prosecuted.

>It said the findings of its investigation into the explosion were based on a review of photos and videos, satellite imagery and interviews with witnesses and experts.


Or Hamas?

>Senior Hamas official Basem Naim told Reuters all indications pointed to Israel's responsibility, adding that the HRW report was biased towards Israel and was not ""decisive"".

>""HRW hasn't come up with any evidence to support their findings nor eyewitness testimonies nor opinion of independent military exports,"" he said, 

I dug out the HRW report itself, here's some choice quotes:

>The Ministry of Health in Gaza reported that 471 people were killed and 342 injured. Human Rights Watch was unable to corroborate the count, which is significantly higher than other estimates, displays an unusually high killed-to-injured ratio, and appears out of proportion with the damage visible on site.

.

>Gaza authorities appear to be in possession of remnants that would help make a conclusive determination of the munition that exploded at al-Ahli hospital. A photo taken the evening of the explosion shows employees of the Explosive Ordnance Department, a specialized Gaza police unit, working on the crater. A witness who was at the hospital on the evening of the explosion told Human Rights Watch that employees of “the Ministry of Interior took all the shrapnel that was on the site.”

>A Hamas official said the remnants would “soon be shown to the world.” More than a month after the events, this has not happened. Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas leader and deputy minister in the Hamas-led Gaza governing authority, told the media on October 22 that “the missile has dissolved like salt in the water.… It’s vaporized. Nothing is left.” Human Rights Watched noted that substantial portions of munitions typically survive a detonation, even if parts of munitions are designed to break apart and may be made unrecognizable by thermal damage.

Seems to be a rather detailed report, better than I was expecting from HRW at this point

2023-11-27 02:16:38,worldnews,Palestine,184nbsv,kax7fsg,Human Rights Watch says rocket misfire likely cause of deadly Gaza hospital blast,"I’m glad HRW finally came around, but this is so frustrating because HRW acted so irresponsibly when this all first happened. 

People all over the world and especially across the Middle East *lost their minds over this explosion* near the hospital - there were riots in the streets, attacks on Israeli and US embassies, molotov cocktails were thrown at a synagogue in Berlin, a historic synagogue in Tunisia was burnt down - it was chaos.  The protests were so violent people got killed!  

And it was all because organizations like HRW and mainstream media outlets reported whatever Hamas told them. They were all primed and ready and happy to believe that Israel did something horrible on purpose.  They desperately wanted to report on *anything* that would shift the narrative away from Hamas’s barbarism and depravity on October 7 back to their usual “Israel bad” script. 

**Sometimes a flare goes up and you can see where people really stand.** HRW, Reuters, NYT, the AP, Amnesty were all shown in those early days of the war to be totally irresponsible, dangerously reckless, and biased against Israel.

The whole issue is a political minefield for them, as support for the Palestinian cause is very strong in the Arab “street”; having to actually go after Hamas faces them with a choice of bad options - actually police Hamas (with the inevitable cry that they are occupiers themselves or working for the Israelis); or, more likely, don’t police Hamas - so ending up either completely pointless, like the UN in Lebanon, or complicit in Hamas attacks, leading to hostilities with Israel. 

Why would they willingly do this? To please the Americans? Certainly not because they actually want good outcomes for Palestinian civilians - none of the Arab leaders particularly care about that, with the exception of the Jordanians, who have no choice but to care.

If the UN can't call out and also blame Hamas, Can't demand unconditional return of hostages, and can't even acknowledge the dysfunction of the UNRWA, then this guy has to go before things can get worse if possible. 

As it stands now, everything he speaks with his bias against Israel and in support of Hamas (by not calling out and condeming) he's just going to harden positions. 

The way he speaks pisses me off and wants me to see Israel finish the job and get the hostages since there is no international support to help Israel except the US.  With Schumer supporting the squad against Israel, this may next depend on whether Trump gets back in office to support Israel.

The judicial overhaul protests were hundreds of thousands, not thousands. Most Israelis who want hostages back also acknowledge that leaving the job unfinished, with Hamas in power, is only going to lead to a repeat.

Now that Hamas has rejected any deal that returns the hostages for a temporary ceasefire, even if it also comes with releasing thousands of terrorists, most Israelis know the only path forward is dismantling Hamas as the U.S. dismantled ISIS.

Once that’s done, the pressure on Netanyahu to resign will multiply. But most Israelis are not interested in dealing with that while Hamas remains very real across the border.

2024-06-18 10:32:43,worldnews,Palestine,1dijlom,l94v2n7,Hackers linked to Hamas accused of cyberespionage in Palestine,">**Hackers linked to Hamas have been implicated in five cyberespionage campaigns targeting Palestine and Egypt.**

>The evidence emerged in new research from ESET, a cybersecurity company based in Slovakia. Analysts at the firm detected five campaigns spreading trojanized apps to Android users. The attacks focus on user data espionage in Palestine and Egypt.

>The campaigns deploy multistage Android spyware, which ESET calls “AridSpy.”

>To distribute the spyware, the hackers used dedicated websites that impersonate real apps. In Palestine, they primarily harnessed a malicious Palestinian Civil Registry app.

>“In order to gain initial access to the device, the threat actors try to convince their potential victim to install a fake, but functional, app,” said Lukáš Štefanko, the ESET researcher who discovered AridSpy.

>“Once the target clicks the site’s download button, myScript.js, hosted on the same server, is executed to generate the correct download path for the malicious file.”

>ESET attributed the campaigns — with “medium confidence” — to the notorious Arid Viper APT group.

>**Who is Arid Viper?**

>Arid Viper is also known as APT-C-23, Desert Falcons, or Two-tailed Scorpion. Active since at least 2013, the cyberespionage group is notorious for targeting countries in the Middle East. It’s also known for deploying a vast arsenal of malware for Android, iOS, and Windows platforms.

>Cybersecurity vendors have previously linked the group to Hamas. It primarily targets entities in Israel and Palestine, but its reach extends beyond these borders. Analysts have said this hints at a broader geopolitical agenda.

>ESET’s new research, however, makes no accusations of political connections. The company has instead focused on the cyberespionage techniques.

>These techniques enable the hackers to spy on messaging apps and exfiltrate content from devices. ESET said their campaigns began in 2022. Three of them remain active today.",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1dijlom/hackers_linked_to_hamas_accused_of_cyberespionage/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1dijlom/hackers_linked_to_hamas_accused_of_cyberespionage/l94v2n7

2024-06-07 15:47:05,worldnews,Palestine,1dadzav,l7jl6or,Israel suggests Labour are ‘rewarding terrorists’ with Palestine manifesto vow,"Israel has reacted with anger to Labour’s manifesto pledge to recognise a Palestinian state before the end of any peace negotiations, suggesting Sir Keir Starmer wants to “reward terrorists”.

A leak of the manifesto revealed by **i** showed Labour would go further than the current UK Government, by supporting statehood for Palestinians “as part of a peace process” rather than after it has concluded.

The Labour leader insisted on Friday that this would not happen while Hamas retained control in Gaza as Israel being “safe and secure” would be a precondition to the move.

But Israeli government spokesman David Mencer told **i**: “Countries embarking on this path should ask themselves this simple question: does their action support peace-makers or does it reward terrorists?

“Eight months to the day since the horrors of 7 October and the Palestinian Authority (PA) have yet to find the time to condemn Hamas.

“All of us here in Israel are left with no other conclusion that the PA thinks what Hamas did on that black day was a good idea.”

As **i** revealed on Thursday, the Labour manifesto – which is being finalised at a meeting in central London – would support Palestinian statehood as part of the Middle East peace process.

The party still backs international efforts to pursue a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians.

During a campaign visit in Brent Cross on Friday, Starmer did not deny that the manifesto pledge would involve recognition during peace negotiations.

He was asked by reporters to categorically rule out Labour recognising Palestine while Hamas retains some control in [Gaza](https://inews.co.uk/topic/gaza?ico=in-line_link), and to explain at what stage in a peace process the party would recognise a state.

The Labour leader said: “Thank you for raising that because it’s very important that I set out for what our position is, which is to recognise Palestine as part of the process to a two-state solution, but part of the process.

“So that means it’s got to be at the right time in the process because we need a viable Palestinian state alongside a safe and secure Israel, to your point.

“We don’t have either of those at the moment. And therefore it’s got to be at the point in the process where we can see both of those outcomes.

“It is important for me to say that recognising Palestine… is not the gift of Israel or anyone else. It is a right but it has to be in the process so that both things happen, a viable Palestinian state and a safe and secure Israel.

“Neither of those things are the position at the moment.”

Inclusion of the pledge in the manifesto is an apparent attempt to stave off Labour losing votes on the left, after Starmer was criticised for being too slow to back an immediate ceasefire in Gaza – which triggered the resignations of Labour councillors.

There were signs that Starmer’s earlier stance had cost Labour some votes in the local and mayoral elections in May.

Following the announcement by Ireland, Spain and Norway that they plan to recognise a state of Palestine, Labour said if elected into government it would begin discussions “in earnest” with “like-minded countries”.

2024-04-10 11:51:44,worldnews,Palestine,1c0jnk2,kywpycb,"US needs Europe to face down Russia and China, says Nato deputy chief","***The Telegraph reports:***

The United States needs its European allies to face down the threat of Russia and China, the deputy secretary general of Nato has told The Telegraph.

There are fears Donald Trump could halt military support for Ukraine if he wins November’s presidential election, or even withdraw Washington’s security guarantee for Europe entirely.

But Mircea Geoană said that with the West locked in an era of “great power competition” with autocratic countries such as Russia, its ally China, North Korea and Iran, the transatlantic alliance was more important than ever.

“As much Europe needs America, America, I think needs all its allies,” he told The Telegraph.

“The strategic reality is that China is a formidable challenger and that Russia and China and all the others together will create massive attempts to disrupt American power.”

**‘Epic struggle’**

He added: “There is an intense aggressive interest from these countries to basically challenge the world order which was introduced after the end of the Second World War.

“In this epic struggle America will need not only its own strength, but also all the allies in the Alliance.”

Mr Trump has warned he would let Russia do “whatever they hell they want” to any Nato member who does not meet its alliance defence spending target of 2 per cent of its economic output.

He was widely criticised for undermining the principle that an attack on one member is one on all the members of the Alliance.

“We worked for four years with president Trump in the White House. The beginning was quite tumultuous,” Mr Geoană said of a period when Mr Trump branded Nato “obsolete”.

But he said that Mr Trump had been “quite positive” about Nato in his final State of the Union address. He added that the race with Joe Biden was “way too close to call”.

Mr Geoană said: “I think strategic logic will prevail and we are confident that America will continue as they’ve done for the last 75 years and continue to be a key player.”

The United States remains the single largest donor of weapons and aid to Ukraine but some believe Europe is not doing enough to help Ukraine.

2024-05-15 15:05:09,worldnews,Palestine,1cslkyx,l45zj1n,Polish foreign minister hits back at Israeli ambassador for UN Palestine vote criticism,">Poland’s foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, has hit back at Israeli ambassador Yacov Livne for criticising Warsaw’s decision to support Palestinian membership of the UN.

>Livne warned that the decision would “harm Poland”. But Sikorski today responded by labelling the remarks “patronising” and saying that it is “the Polish government, not foreign ambassadors, which will decide what is good for Poland”.


>On Friday, Poland was among the majority of 143 countries to vote in favour of supporting Palestine’s bid to become a full member of the UN.

>Only nine countries opposed the motion: the United States, Argentina, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea and Israel itself. A further 25 – including Canada, Germany, Italy, Ukraine and the United Kingdom – abstained.

>Following the vote, Livne took to X to criticise Poland’s decision. He warned that it set a “dangerous precedent of rewarding the aggressor”, that it “continued the 1988 Soviet-led anti-West decision of recognising [a] ‘Palestinian state'”, that it “rewarded Iran and Hamas”, and that it was a “complete violation of the UN charter”.

>“This is a wrong and harmful decision for security, stability, and for Poland,” added the ambassador.


>In an interview on Tuesday morning with Polskie Radio, Sikorski noted that an “ambassador has the right to express the views or interests of his country”. He added, however, that “the Polish government will decide what is good for Poland, not foreign ambassadors”.

>“I think that the ambassador needs to get to know us better and realise that we, as Poles, react badly to a patronising tone,” added the minister.

>He went on to clarify that Poland’s decision at the UN “was not a vote against Israel, it was a vote in favour of a two-state solution in line with the Polish policy of recognising Palestinian statehood that we have been pursuing for more than three decades”.

>Today, Sikorski’s ministry also published posts on social media wishing Israel “peace and prosperity” on the occasion of its independence day.


>Recent weeks have seen heightened tensions between Poland and Israel, in particular following the death of a Polish aid worker, Damian Soból, during the Israeli strike on a World Central Kitchen convoy in Gaza.

>Livne’s initial refusal to apologise for the incident – and his claims that some Polish politicians were stoking antisemitism by suggesting Israel deliberately attacked the convoy – caused anger in Poland. President Andrzej Duda and Prime Minister Donald Tusk were among those to criticise him.

>Subsequently, Livne was summoned to the Polish foreign ministry, where he delivered an apology.",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1cslkyx/polish_foreign_minister_hits_back_at_israeli/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1cslkyx/polish_foreign_minister_hits_back_at_israeli/l45zj1n

Understand there are countries such as Russia that consider us foreign adversaries and have been known to manipulate social media content to polarize people especially when it comes to LGBT issues, they especially have roots in conservative social media, where they have the capability to influence people on a mass scale.

It's a national security issue and more should be done to protect the vulnerable LGBT community.

https://www.stalbertgazette.com/local-news/did-reddit-year-end-recaps-expose-russian-interference-in-alberta-8223476

There are clear goals being perpetuated by information warfare campaigns. Especially by Russia, whose information warfare campaigns are wreaking havoc on our society. Some of the obvious goals they have are:

• Balkanize their foreign adversaries. This is evident in the UK leaving the EU, Texas with the US, and Alberta with Canada. This is what Danielle Smith is trying to tap into.

• Have populist politicians support policies that cause chaos and issues in our society. Populist politicians are tapping into these information warfare campaigns to appeal to people whose only access to information about the outside world around them is through social media, where the information warfare is taking place.

• Cause distrust and havoc, by creating specialized propaganda to different segments of the population spread through social media. By polarizing debates through propaganda spread to the masses, Russia has effectively used information warfare to deliver targeted disinformation and appeal to specific demographics. Causing havoc in the LBGT and other minority communities.

• Russia has effectively infiltrated the religious right in America and Canada and empowered them, among many corrupt leaders worldwide through its information warfare.

I can cite my sources if needed.

Putin literally bombed his own people to lock down his power and control. Why should we trust that he is not carrying out horrible atrocities like using information warfare on Canadian citizens to terrorize the LGBT community? He doesn't seem to have any moral qualms with anything and corruption is part of his shtick. He used a nerve agent to publicly poison a turned intelligence asset at a important time in history to signify to his intelligence assets what can be done to them, but in reality, he is just a weak man, who is bitter about the break up of the empire he devoted his life to.

It you want to know more, there is a great documentary series on Netflix about the history that has led to this moment in time. Turning Point - The Bomb and the Cold War on Netflix. Not as much about the information warfare, that I have gleamed through other sources, but it does slightly touch on that.",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1c22coe/un_speaks_of_existential_threat_to_the_people_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1c22coe/un_speaks_of_existential_threat_to_the_people_of/kz9fzjk

>In both Kibbutz Beeri and Kibbutz Kfar Azza, as well as at the site of the Nova Music Festival in Re’im, I witnessed scenes of calculated cruelty. The attacks against innocent Israeli civilians on 7 October represent some of the most serious international crimes that shock the conscience of humanity, crimes which the ICC was established to address.

For those unaware; this is how the global macro economy has crushed countless African nations and agrarian based economies, and is also a means of crushing domestic farmers and business in developed nations.

What occurs is you have multi national corporations like Monsanto receiving substantial subsidies from governments like the USA or Canada. The subsidy is an export subsidy, which then allows the corporation to sell food goods below world market price.

The corporation then floods a state; in this case Poland; with goods that the micro economy simply cannot compete with. As the farmers of the target state fail,  enter Monsanto, who then purchases the capacity and land at a discount rate.

I don’t think Hamas ever would have released Noa. They were having too much fun using her as constant propaganda in the psychological war on Israel. Hamas knew it would be a massive boost to Israel’s morale to see Noa freed (which it did) so they’d rather torpedo an extra day of ceasefire rather than release her in negotiations.

If the article is correct, I don’t understand why Hamas insisted on listing Carmel Gat as a solider. She was 39 years old, an Occupational Therapist and just returned from a yoga retreat in India. She was initially kept in an apartment with 2 children, a preteen and teenager, who found out after the hostage release that both their parents were murdered. Carmel helped those traumatized kids cope in captivity with yoga. The kids later told their uncle that Hamas took them to ‘go to the bathroom’ and never informed Carmel of their release. 

I’m heartbroken for Carmel. Logistics wise, they were already releasing 2 children in the same location as her.

After Britain occupied it and Jews started returning to Israel, the Egyptians and Jordanians (identical ethnically) started moving there to contest the Jews claim on the land.

* A Hamas-linked website on Monday warned Palestinian individuals or groups against co-operating with Israel to provide security for aid convoys amid the five-month-old war in the Gaza Strip.
* Those who did would be treated as collaborators and be handled with an iron fist, the Hamas Al-Majd security website said, quoting a security official in Palestinian militant forces
* The warning came in response to Israeli media reports that Israel was considering arming some Palestinian individuals or clans in Gaza to provide security protection for aid convoys into the besieged enclave as part of wider planning for humanitarian supplies after the fighting ends.
* ""The occupation's attempt to communicate with the leaders and clans of some families to operate within the Gaza Strip is considered direct collaboration with the occupation and is a betrayal of the nation that we will not tolerate,"" the website said, quoting the official
* Gaza has several large traditional family clans, affiliated with political factions including Hamas and Fatah, the rival group that dominates the Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank. Some of those clans are believed to be well-armed and there has been no indication that they would consider working with Israel.",398,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1bc371e/hamaslinked_website_warns_palestinians_not_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1bc371e/hamaslinked_website_warns_palestinians_not_to/kud4bid

>It urges Moscow to cease military actions and return the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and Azov Sea ports to Ukrainian control.

>The draft condemns the threat of nuclear weapon use in the conflict and decries attacks on commercial ships and civilian port infrastructure. It demands the return of all Ukrainian children and civilians unlawfully taken to Russia.

>White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan highlighted Qatar's mediation in returning over 30 Ukrainian children from Russia. Kyiv claims around 20,000 children have been taken to Russia or Russian-occupied territories without consent, a claim Moscow denies, asserting it has protected vulnerable children.

>The official declaration is set to be issued at the conclusion of the summit, held in the Swiss resort of Bürgenstock, which aims to initiate a peace process for Ukraine with over 100 world leaders and organizations in attendance.

>Key figures such as U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and French President Emmanuel Macron are among those present. Poland is represented by the country’s president Andrzej Duda.

No other group of people in the world have a multi billion organisation dedicated to babysitting them. Whilst there are peoples in other regions who deserve it just as much. Instead, let the global UN do it's work there.

The UNRWA is a self sustaining machine that employs thousands. It's in their best interest to not fully resolve the situation, to not create meaningful solutions to long term changes in Palestina that fight extremism, religious and economic inequality. Instead of fostering growth and sustainable relationships with Israel they fund things that often have no long term benefit. But why would they? They'll all be without jobs and money if they solve the issues on the ground. There are thousands of organisations world wide who's only mission is to work just hard enough to stay employed and receive free money. To perpetuate their own existance. 

UNWRA has overlapping positions and goals with it's parent organisation and a low degree of efficiency.

“Disheartened by Switzerland Parliament’s national council move to cut aid to @UNRWA, as the Agency is recognized as a major humanitarian actor in #Gaza & the region,” the commissioner-general of the group Philippe Lazzarini wrote on X following the news. “Hope the Senate will revise this decision as @UNRWA is the first responder in Gaza and a lifeline for millions.”


“As a country that leads on International Humanitarian Law, I am disappointed in this decision to cut aid to the largest and most active Humanitarian Agency on the ground in #Gaza today. Cutting funds jeopardizes services during an unfolding humanitarian catastrophe.”

UNRWA’s official account also bemoaned the move, calling it a “disappointment as our teams on [the] ground continue to do the impossible to help more than 1.3 million people in our shelters.”",187,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/18ha5zy/swiss_parliament_moves_to_cut_ties_with_unrwa/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/18ha5zy/swiss_parliament_moves_to_cut_ties_with_unrwa/kd5bdwn

No? That was never the purpose of the UN. It exists so that states have a viable alternative to war as a means of conflict resolution. *A UN ambassador should know this!* The Korean War, the Suez Crisis, the Invasion of Kuwait are all examples of the UN at full capacity. The only reason the UN has dropped the ball so many times is because the Security Council is treated as a dick measuring contest by the Permanent 5.

Just look at Ukraine, under the UN charter every member state is - *theoretically* \- obligated to commit forces to aid in their defensive war. However, the General Assembly can only request that the Security Council invoke the collective defense clause. That just isn't possible 99% of the time because one of the P5 always vetoes it. In the case of the Gulf War, the Soviets joined France, the United Kingdom, and the United States in approving the collective defense request. China abstained.

Whenever the P5 put their own disagreements aside, the UN functions. There are solutions to that, but to say the UN has failed when our planet hasn't been reduced to large swathes radioactive wasteland is complete bullshit.",18,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/18cvr4z/the_un_has_failed_its_head_needs_to_resign/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/18cvr4z/the_un_has_failed_its_head_needs_to_resign/kcegbvh

In many comments I’ve made in the past about the settlements and West Bank in particular: I have quite harsh opinions about the “outpost settlers”.

They decide that placing 5 trailers and a synagogue tent in the middle of Palestinian territory is perfectly fine and then the army is forced to protect them, risking our soldiers in unnecessary places.

It also takes more forces to backup such units, they are better used in Gaza or up north, or even at home allowing a better rate of rotation between units. All while this particular demographic doesn’t serve in the IDF.

I am not talking about settlements like Ariel with 150,000 residents, hospitals and a university, who I think should stay Israeli in any case of peace agreement. 

And the fact that BBC made this distinction is great, because now I can say- arrest them, dismantle these outposts. Free our soldiers to do whatever else needed.

The Palestinian Authority has a GDP the size of a small town. Its resources are spread to the breaking point just managing ongoing West Bank displacements. They have no experience in counterinsurgency, and no operational capacity for aid delivery.

At best, they could deliver moral support to an Israeli occupation and reconstruction effort, if Israel was going to commit to funding and staffing it.

But even that moral support would be very difficult to provide. Hamas was able to gain power in Gaza because the people lost hope for any other solution to their problems. There doesn't seem to be an understanding in Israel that the Oslo accords were already very optimistic about how little Palestine could survive on, and that it's simply not possible to create a Palestinian state with less. Quite the opposite, the West Bank is still shrinking, and it seems as though the Palestinian Archipelago of more than 100 disconnected West Bank enclaves will continue to shrink and remain Bantustans indefinitely.

Right now, they cannot even promise Gaza that they'll be economically integrated as a Bantustan, let alone become a stable state. Just bringing Gaza up to being only as bad as the Palestinian West Bank would take decades of work with an annual budget twice the PA's entire GDP. 

It's not something the PA can achieve. If they try, they'll fail, and lose any credibility they have as moderate voices advocating less extreme forms of resistance. The only real solution to this is to build a Gaza that can be economically integrated with its neighbors, with real opportunities, and a tax base capable of resisting extremist groups. And that kind of nation building takes a real country funding and performing it, not an organization with a budget the size of a small suburban mayor's office.",20,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/17odc83/palestinian_authority_should_play_key_role_in_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/17odc83/palestinian_authority_should_play_key_role_in_a/k7y4vwh

This is just the most recent of many events like this that have made the news, plus I see anecdotal claims by women who live and have traveled there that this is a serious concern. 

Is it a cultural thing, societal, religious? Is it just a certain sect or subset of men or is this a common sentiment that this is okay? Are the women helping raising these kind of men? Are they complicit in the society or are they just not able to stop boys from becoming these men? 

And why is anyone trying to cover it up or minimize it?

Can anyone with familiarity with Indian society help me out here?

It just seems like a thing in this country for men, not just individuals but whole groups of men together to do nasty things to women and the powers that be don't ever seem concerned until it comes out.

Or maybe it's just the fact that it's reported often but isn't really as prevalent as media makes it seem?

There are more cases, there's a thread in Indian subreddit that compiled multiple cases of gangrapes & paedophilic rapes in just 24 hours happened in India's Independence day.

Now add the institutional gang rape, brutal torture & murder of the Kolkata doctor & the institution itself trying to cover it up, there's no hope for India.

Another rape happened related to this Kolkata case. This time another medical student got raped as she was protesting for the victim of gangrape in Kolkata 

Yes, India is facing a rape crisis. It became such a common occurrence that people grew desensitized to these types of news. Many rapes reported in regional news don't even make it to national coverage. This has always been the case. However, thanks to social media, international audiences are now becoming aware of it. India deserves to be shamed on the world stage for the government to take action regarding law and order. The Indian government doesn't care about local protests because they eventually die down until the next horrific crime makes the news. But the Indian government does care about its perception abroad. Don't let any extreme Indian nationalist tell you that shaming India for rapes is racism.
