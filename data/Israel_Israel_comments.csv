7th october was the most deadly terrorist attack for french people since the one in Nice. 40 of our citizens died because of Hamas, but we have only seen a ceremony months later. 80 of our citizens died in the 80s because of an attack of the Hezbollah, but Macron never mentionned it and said that the attacks targetting Hezbollah were endangering civilians which is false. He is a weak ass president, one of the worst we had in recent time, he doesn't want to let go even though with the recent elections he can't govern anymore. 

Anyway, there is still a lot of support for Israel in France, and the leftists that are pro-palestine are very hated in a general manner. They've been rightly accused of antisemitism and it is in public debate.

They are also one of the most aggressive and toxic movements around. Think about this they normalized casually talking about wiping an entire country off the map and at best mass deporting people. This is beyond government or societal criticism because even places like Russia, Iran, China, Syria, and the US (which they also hate) are not spoken about this way. With the history they want people to think Jews only appeared in the Middle East suddenly after wwii because of ""European guilt"" where they immediately just slaughtered everyone who was living in peace. They will also never, ever acknowledge the countless Jews expelled from Muslim countries that ended up going to Israel because it's perhaps the most damning thing against their arguments. It's also rare for them to acknowledge any non Arab people in general living in the Middle East or North Africa outside of places like Iran. 

The best results I've had dealing with people is simply just letting them know a handful of historical facts. Either they will reveal themselves as too far gone or they'll be genuinely surprised that they were so misinformed.

Actual reason & quote:

Ms Johansson stepped down as an Oxfam ambassador following a row over her endorsement of the Israeli drinks company SodaStream.

Oxfam had objected to Ms Johansson‚Äôs involvement with the firm over what the charity regards as an illegal factory in the West Bank.

But Ms Johansson said she and the charity had a ""fundamental difference of opinion"" over the company's base in Mishor Adumim, next to the Ma'ale Adumim settlement.

She stepped down as their ambassador saying: ‚ÄúI remain a supporter of economic co-operation and social interaction between a democratic Israel and Palestine.

‚ÄúSodaStream is not only committed to the environment but to building a bridge to peace between Israel and Palestine, supporting neighbours working alongside each other, receiving equal pay, equal benefits and equal rights.‚Äù",155,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1dfalxu/jewish_beauties_stand_with_israel/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1dfalxu/jewish_beauties_stand_with_israel/l8if1wq

Israel hasn't lost the support of the world.  Despite all the talk against Israel, there have been very few actions against it.

But Hamas is rebuilding in areas the IDF has vacated, and 60,000+ Israelis have been exiled from their homes for almost a year.  

It's losing diplomatically.  The ICJ is about to issue arrest warrants to Israel; the UK, Germany, and U.S. have all stopped weapons sales to one degree or another; and states that used to be somewhat sensible such as France and Spain just supported a measure to ethnically cleanse 700,000 Jews from their home, make the Old City of Jerusalem Judenrein, and demand the withdraw of all Israeli military forces even without any peace partner on the Palestinian side.  

Meanwhile, the ""laws of war"" have been distorted in such a way that ""experts"" now insist that terrorist organizations hiding in schools and hospitals must enjoy immunity from attack, and that even the most precise counter-terror op in history (the Hezbollah pagers/walkie-talkies) is condemned as a ""war crime.""

Don't kid yourself - we're losing diplomatically.  And, while most of this isn't Israel's fault, there have been a number of public comments by Netanyahu, Smotich, and Ben-Gvir that have fueled the fires of hatred.

I think your analysis focuses too heavily on our borders, which is surrounded by Iran's proxies. They call it the ring of fire.

On a micro level, i agree that we are on the winning side.

On the macro level, however, Iran is the big winner. They let us battle with their proxies while they finalize their nuclear weapons. Iran does not care about Gaza, they do not care about lebanon, they care only for the destruction  of Israel.

One day we will wake up, and it will be the beginning of a new era, where we live under nuclear threat, and we won't be able to do anything about it. Oh, and they will gladly wipe us all from earth, if they could. They simply cannot do it - yet.

If they funded terrorists who beheaded babies, they won't suddenly stop at nuclear. There are no real red lines for these terrorists.

If we keep on focusing on our borders, as you suggest, we will lose.

The news media in my country makes it sound like Israel is suffering immensely and Iran is this superpower that is destroying Israel. Not only that I'm seeing the people between Israel and Iran - not the leaders, the people - speak respectfully of each other on both sides. 

Now I am thinking the news that is fed to me in my country is completely mislead. It seems to me that Israel is much stronger than we are led to believe, Iran is much weaker and there's actually love between the regular citizens. Would anyone be willing to shed some light on this? Am I seeing things correctly? I hate the tension but am 100% in favor of defending yourself and I am admittedly confused but fascinated at the same time after spending some time reading some posts.

resident of Lod tried to smuggle 9 illegal residents under the double side of a truck

Earlier today, our forces operating in the  Eliyahu crossing area ordered the driver of a suspicious truck to stop.  In response, the driver began trying to escape while driving in the opposite lane and hit one of the police officers who slightly injured his hand.

In response, the forces fired at the vehicle's wheels and then stopped the vehicle.  During a careful search and thanks to the determination and professionalism of the forces, 9 illegal residents were located behind a double wall.  The driver of the vehicle, a 50-year-old resident of Lod, was arrested and transferred along with the illegal residents for further investigation at the Central Police Department's central unit.

Edit for clarification

Gaza lighting refers to the Palestinian supporters at gaslight Jewish people online in the name of the people of Gaza. Not to suggest that Israel has a war against everyone in Gaza just Hamas.

However, all the crap being said at Jewish people and people that support Israel, all the death threats, all the hate crimes, all the public calls for violence, and all the actual violence are being done in the name of the people in Gaza.

I‚Äôll make this very clear:
No one but the state of Israel has authority over the state of Israel ,because no one can guarantee Israel‚Äôs safety better than Israel, and most people don‚Äôt even have Israel‚Äôs safety and security in mind. This conversation cannot be held without you (or anyone else in your position) firstly stating that Israel has a right to exist and defend itself. Then and only then we can start talking about logistics.

World leaders took an advantage of Israel‚Äôs unfortunate situation while Israel was (and still is) at its lowest point, to prompt themselves up politically and morally. And to me it goes to show the true intentions of anyone who is so keen on getting themselves involved in this issue.

The fact that you can question the morals of the only Jewish state, but you won‚Äôt even mention the terrorism and genocidal intent on the other side says a lot about you in my opinion.

You very clearly say that Israel is obligated to ethnically cleanse itself of certain areas, without saying anything about the fact that Israel has evacuated these settlements in the past, and it resulted in the situation we see today. are you ignorant of that historical fact or are you intentionally avoiding it to frame your question in a way that will frame Israel as the perpetrators?

When you look at Israel through the prism of WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) critical theories and intersectionality. Through this wonderful prism I can easily make the claim that Ta-Nehisi Coates is white and culturally appropriates black culture and identity.

Just like they claim that Israelis are all white imperialist colonists, despite half of us originating from Muslim Arab countries that expelled most of us. Just like they claim that raising the pride flag by any Israeli is pinkwashing cause an 'oppressor' cannot be part of the LGBT fight for rights. So Ethiopian Jews are actually white and any Israeli gay is actually a heterosexual cisgender that just has sex with other men, sex that oppresses Palestinians and their right for self-determination, no less.

Once you start comparing American race relations, Apartheid South, or European colonization of the Americas/Africa/Asia to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict, you are no where close to objective reality. 

The I/P conflict is really a symptom of the Israeli - Arab conflict that has been reignited by Iran and its proxies. 

The reality is that Palestinian refugee issue cannot be fixed without buy in from the other middle eastern nations. 

After all, it was the decision of Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Egypt to keep almost 2 million Palestinians as second class citizens. 

It‚Äôs also the Muslim world‚Äôs fault that they arm and fund Hamas and PIJ, but don‚Äôt fund other Palestinian organizations that would focus on building a future for Palestinians. 

This is because they are under the illusion that Israel is an occupying force. The problem with this illusion is that Israelis are the descendants of refugees and have no where else to call home. 

Israel is here to stay and until the Muslims realize that there will always be conflict. 

The Palestinians are caught between the Jewish people trying to survive in the land of their ancestors and the greater Arab/Muslim world giving them no other choice but to fight the Jews. 

That‚Äôs the truth that Ta-Nehisi Coates will never understand as rich westerner who views all issues through the lens of American Racial relations.

The fact that, when polled, around \~70% of Palestinians support things like 9/11, the oct 7th terror attacks, suicide bombings, etc is lost on their supporters in the west. So is the fact that many/most Palestinians democratically elected Hamas and support Hamas's actions in this war.

Its a desperately naive viewpoint. Another thing that sucks is the far left says they are 'anti-racist' but racism is the root cause of the hatred that so many Arabs feel for Israel. They can't accept that Jewish people live in their neighborhood.

Also its been really disgusting to watch the far left who constantly talk about how anti-war they are root and cheer when Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran commit violence against Israel.

Diaspora Lebanese Christians are oftentimes very fond of Israel, you should include all three of these words together, for similar reasons to Indians.

Eastern Europeans are typically very pro-Israel. I think partly because they are nationalistic and relate to Israel, and also that they have a connection to Jews and an affinity for us. Poland is an exception, but this is due to lots of recent drama between Poland and Israel. I don't think it's a forever thing.

They're anti-vax, anti immigrant, anti-gay and their vain-glorious leader loves to surround himself with leather clad 'body guards' while riding a Harley Davidson. He preys upon his poor followers demanding tithes and kicks them from his congregation if they don't regularly throw $50 notes onto his stage. The only reason that they look Maori is that Maori are way over-represented in the poverty statistics, and his churches are setup in those communities.  
Destiny Church is embarrassing to most New Zealanders and are regularly made fun of in the media.Their leader will say anything to keep his name prominent. Including such things as 'The Christchurch earthquake was because god hates gays',  'God has told me I will be Prime Minister' (during election time), and claiming a mass murderer's shooting rampage was the fault of the victims (who were literally knelt in prayer).

2024-06-09 15:10:57,Israel,Israel,1dbv20x,l7to96z,3 things Israel needs to do after the war.,"1.  The entire IDF needs to be restructured.  This includes dealing with ""open-fire"" rules and providing for cultural training and awareness.  In the US, they get lots of sheltered young people, especially from working and lower middle class.  They understand that Bubba from Alabama doesn't have any experience with the Middle East so they provide that training before they ship him overseas.  Mad Dog Mattis made the entire Marine Corps take such a class prior to shipping them to Iraq.  There needs to be a similar class for all the IDF which doesn't seem to be happening likely because of political considerations.

2.   The education system needs to be dealt with.  Israelis should be provided with exposure to their entire society and should grow up with a shared narrative.  It's baffling to me that many Arabs haven't visited Yad Vashem and many Jews haven't visited some of the prominent Christian shrines or a mosque.  The ""tribes"" should be together in schools as much as possible and Arabic and Hebrew should be taught.  Students needs to also be exposed to the ""warts"" in Israeli history and Israeli society, not just the nice patriotic narrative.  It's similar to the US discussing slavery and Jim Crow and Germany reckoning with Nazism.

3.  The extremist settlers need to be dealt with.  There needs to be arrests of those who commit pogroms against the Palestinians.  The schools that cater to the haradal need to be investigated for teaching extremism and violence.  Those boys who attack Palestinians in the Old City during the Flag Parade are there with their schools, who aren't disciplining them.

4.  There needs to be a written constitution to work through all the various controversies in Israeli society.  There was a proposal in the spring of 2023 during the judicial reform protests for a constituent assembly to draft such a constitution.

5.  There needs to be a settlement freeze.  It can be done in conjunction of the Saudi deal.  Steps should be taken to ""thin out"" the settlements through population attrition.  I understand the deep skepticism people have about a Palestinian state but this will keep the door open to negotiations in the long-term.  Also, not having settlements there will allow the IDF to focus on terrorism, not guarding the settlers, and would minimize points of friction between the Palestinians and Jews.",125,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1dbv20x/3_things_israel_needs_to_do_after_the_war/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1dbv20x/3_things_israel_needs_to_do_after_the_war/l7to96z
2024-06-09 15:10:45,Israel,Israel,1dbv20x,l7to81b,3 things Israel needs to do after the war.,"I agree with 1 and also feel the need to emphasize that the purpose is not to appease the international community with optics. Soldiers acting irresponsibly and without discipline leads to officers who act irresponsibly and without discipline, and that leads to October 7th. We've been letting a lot of shit slide just because ""Israelis be Israelis"" but when you make shitty behavior the norm then you get officers unwilling to do anything about it.

Itzhak Brik may be the most depressing person to listen to right now but he makes excellent points about the state of the IDF right now.

2024-06-09 16:21:49,Israel,Israel,1dbv20x,l7u010u,3 things Israel needs to do after the war.,"1. While I do agree, reality is that Its very hard to keep discipline amongst reservists so I am not sure how you want to do it exactly. either you send them to reserve duty often to enforce discipline - which is going to be a significant financial burden, or you babysit them - which is a manpower burden.  The Haredim conscript would actually help with this issue as if they behave like regular infantry it'd be easier to maintain discipline (but its a big if) and would require less reservists.

2. Israel is overly dependent on China, and detaching from it would be painfully hard probably too painful economically. no one would want to be the guy that gives that economic blow. as for Japan and South Korea they have their own games and goals. while they'd probably be amicable to an improved relationship with Israel I doubt they'd be an ally. not when if it will cost them friends trade partners in the middle east.

3. Russia is a loaded issue. there are too many Israeli-Russian ties, many of which are economic ties. For example pension funds of tens of thousands of elderly people who came from Russia have been essentially been frozen since the Ukrainian war and are being used by Russia as leverage to pressure Israel. You have people in Israel doing business in Russia and vice-versa. you have people with families in Russia sending funds to help their families there.",18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1dbv20x/3_things_israel_needs_to_do_after_the_war/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1dbv20x/3_things_israel_needs_to_do_after_the_war/l7u010u

The war will not last forever, talk to your kaban, you can transfer units to something more jobby if push comes to shove.
I did that way back in my Sadir days after oferet yetzukah and later went back to being combat.
There are many options in which you dont leave the army on a psych dismissal and still get to keep your sanity.

Also, a decently long vacation from it all might also really help you with getting through your service.

Also try talking to people who have been through similar situations, especially family members, what youre have been through will shape your life from now on, its important to channel it into something empowering.

And I am FURIOUS with Hamas, the 7/10, the cowardly tactics of rape/shock/murder of those terrorists (hunt those bastards!),   the ignorance and the antisemitism of people in general. This coming from a not particularly religious, center-left political bias person.

However, this does not mean I endorse the map as it is shown, because even for pragmatical reasons I dont see a peaceful future without the existence of a palestinian state *somewhere*. But also, I dont believe peace talks have a chance with so much hate against jews ingrained in the Middle east. And no, I dont have a suggestion of what how this should be done, but at least I am confessing my ignorance instead of spewing Tik Tok vileness. 

Closing points I just wanted to say: 

- I love the jewish sense of humor and passion for discussion.

- I love the non-proselytism of Judaism. I think it is a quality to not force aNy religious view unto others (and I am NOT an atheist).

- I dont mind nor fault the relative isolationism of jewish community to non-jews, specially considering the centuries of persecution.  As long as there are politeness and the law applied fairly to both sides (feel free to call me na√Øve) why should I *require* for a jew to be socially inclusive to others? Be civil, be chill and treasure inter-community friendships and acquaintances that happen when respect is given.

I don‚Äôt really question anything Israelis do with a clear mind to keep themselves safe. 

The reality is that Israel is a kind, idealistic nation that has handled its conflict with the Palestinians much more gently and respectfully than most nations have treated their comparable conflicts. Israel isn‚Äôt the country freaking out over hijabs. 

I think the challenge, though, is that the Meir Kahane wing has emphasized the old, not-so-wonderful parts of Judaism that treat non-Jews with disdain and views the perspectives of critics with contempt, and that has combined with the Sabra ethos glorification to promote aggressive rudeness toward dovish Israelis, Jews outside Israel and non-Jews. 

I remember reading 10 years ago about Jews harassing what I think was the *observant* granddaughter of my old Orthodox synagogue cantor because she wasn‚Äôt covered up enough by their standards. 

Here on Reddit, I see  streams of posts by allegedly pro-Israel people trashing all Palestinians, trying to mock any views that they or their supporters might have, trashing all leftists, trashing all U.S. Democrats, mocking any concerns about Palestinian civilians, etc. Those folks seem to be doing everything they can to alienate everyone to the left of Vladimir Putin.

Every Israeli I know is kind, polite and completely capable of acknowledging and understanding the unmet needs of the Palestinians. They want good things for themselves. They don‚Äôt want anything bad for peaceful, law-abiding Palestinians. 

 But Israel has let rude Israelis and rude Zionists make Israel look mean and rude. They have kicked Biden, for example, in the face over and over again. Then, when Israel has a bad day, and one person or one team is reckless and causes a catastrophe, the guy Israel kicked in the face over and over surprisingly decides not to go out of his way to defend Israel and point out that mistakes happen and jerks can show up and be jerks in any society. 

Along the same lines, Israel has, for example, killed, trashed and/or excluded  journalists from places like CNN who might be biased against Israel but who could also sometimes verify Israel‚Äôs side.

Shutting out somewhat hostile journalists might feel good, but it means that world news mainly shows reports from the friends of Hamas. Instead of getting media coverage that‚Äôs 70 percent hostile, Israel gets coverage that‚Äôs 95 percent hostile.",21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1buo5h6/head_of_aid_group_struck_by_idf_israel_better/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1buo5h6/head_of_aid_group_struck_by_idf_israel_better/kxvfoft

That said, Israel only has 1/2 the jews in the world. If things got really bad, I would put my things into a storage unit, rent my apartment out, and get on a plane from Los Angeles to Israel, as I expect, would another 2.5 million or so fighting age Jewish males from around the globe. That leaves another 3/4 or so of the diaspora still at home, where they still make an outsized economic impact compared to the population size. You think they would just sit on their hands and let countries they live in watch Israel burn without devastating consequences politically and economically? That's not even considering allies like Christians. The US alone has 100 million practicing Christians - meaning they attend church service at least 2x month. Imagine if 1/2 of 1% refused to allow the holy land to fall to islam, and have the jews all killed. That's another .5 million. Think about how many people volunteered to fight in Ukraine, and most of them didn't have a deep, meaningful, religious connection to them. And this is only the US.¬†

This is a perfect example of the allies showing concern for Israel by putting their internal politics at risk (UK and Jordan especially) and extending a hand in support for Israel.

There is nothing more to be done here with Iran. Israel should focus on an extensive build up of defensive missiles to counter the Iranian build up. Iran has many thousands of cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and drones. Israel has limited defense missiles, despite the amazing technology. Now isn't the time for this war. Israel needs stockpiles.

On the other side of this, it's time to work with the US and Egypt to shutter all smuggling tunnels into Rafah. That requires diplomacy, not an assault on Rafah.

I want the Rafah assault and want to see Hamas totally eliminated. But not at the cost of Israeli isolation. Hamas wants Israeli isolation because they'll fighting a guerrilla war for decades if need be. Don't give them that cover. 

Israel has a chance to change course diplomatically after last night. I want to see it happen. As Benny Gantz said, Israel will be fighting Hamas for decades. Better to maintain friends now and find peace in the region.

2. The Iranian people may be Israel's only natural allies in the region (as opposed to the peaces of convenience with Egypt, Saudi, and Jordan) and they also really hate their regime. A broad strike that turns Iranian public opinion against Israel would squander this rare advantage.

I don't mean any of this in an indignant way or anything strange. I just am curious is all about your story and why you care.

Our whole statement calling this suit blood libel, and entirely without merit, was completely refuted today. Along with it, also similar statements by our allies were refuted. The ICJ, including the US, French and Australian judge ruled that there is a plausible case for genocide. In doing so, it completely sided with SA by stating that there is a plausible case that there are genocidal acts being committed and with genocidal intent based on the many reckless statements made by our government officials. Siding entirely with SA on this point means that the court rejected our arguments that: our attacks are legitimate, the high toll of civilian casualties was caused by Hamas using human shields, that the we let enough aid in and that we follow international law. This is a devastating blow to be honest, I don‚Äôt think it was a solid strategy to appear in this case, but I don‚Äôt think we had much of a choice.

Regarding the measures ordered, it is good that a ceasefire wasn‚Äôt, but the rest of the measures mean that we must fundamentally change our approach to this war. This includes a complete overhaul of our rules of engagement to ensure being extremely careful with civilians and letting tons of more aid in. The court will also monitor our compliance with this in a month, so all eyes are on us. There‚Äôs no use of us saying that we‚Äôre already in compliance, because the court already ruled that we aren‚Äôt (that‚Äôs why it said there‚Äôs a plausible case for genocide).

We're happy to have you here on our sub.
Posts about supposed antisemitism by the people if Ireland have gotten a lot of your attention, and we appreciate you're willingness to discuss with us on this subject.
There are some healthy discussions in this thread, and some nasty conversations. 

It should be stated - Israelis do not harbor any hate for the people of Ireland. Most Israelis don't think anything about Ireland, even during this conflict where Ireland has shown support to the Palestinian cause while disregarding the Israeli suffering.
Israelis, please refrain from broad generalizations over the entire Irish nation (Israelis, we hate when people do it to us. Don't do it to others).

We understand your anger over being accused with such horrible thing called antisemitism, but you should also understand where Jews come from - it doesn't feel nice when people tell you that you don't have to right to exist in your homeland, and this is what a lot the pro Palestinian POV has turned into in the past 2 months.

An important note: you can be both pro Palestinian and pro Israel. You don't have to be anti Israel in order to stand for the Palestinians, and you don't have to hate Palestinians in order to stand with Israel.
And the pro X = anti Y radical ideology is very dangerous.
You can stand with the oppressed, but you also should acknowledge the fact that there are dozens of millions of oppressed people having it far worse than the Palestinians, and we Israelis feel it isn't very fair that the only place where human rights activists are so vocal is when it comes to the Jewish State.

Yes, you can be antisemitic without knowing that you are. A special term was even coined after this phenomenon, [the New antisemitism. ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_antisemitism)
That happens when you hold the Jews accountable for the worst of humanity, but don't judge all other races in the same standard. 
This world view accuses Israel for all of the wrong things of the 20th century (genocide, ethnic cleansing, colonialism, raciam), sayimg Israel is being a criminal oppressor against the completely innocent Palestinians etc. 
This dichotomous rhetoric ignores the complexity of this 75 year old conflict.

All visitors of this sub, Irish, Israeli, Jewish etc., please use this platform for exploring the truth together and not throw hate at each other.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/18k2iyl/ireland_hate_israel_only_because_of_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/18k2iyl/ireland_hate_israel_only_because_of_the/kdqkumv

I'm from Europe, Christian-background (kinda agnostic though), I have been living here in Israel for 4 years.
It's been a while since I've taken to the social media and I've been reporting and exposing the lies against Israel.
These are mostly interactions with anti-Israel posts.

Because of how the algorithm works, my feeds in FB and Threads keep being bombarded with antisemitic shit (and it's not even veiled anymore).
On top of that, I had ex colleagues from Italy and family members buying into the Iranian bullshit. And I think that's what hurts the most - they value the lies they hear in the news, more than the value my words.

Add to that the stress of reading the news and wondering what's gonna happen. Some of the news really keeps me up at night - I know some are psychological warfare, but there is a part in me that believes there is more.

I also got to a point where I reached a burn out. I want to put away every social network and stop reading the news, in the hope it will go away. But I can't.
On one side I feel like I need to know what's happening, to be prepared. On the other side, I feel like I need to keep fighting back, because otherwise it's like admitting defeat.

Running to the shelter when a siren goes off is stressful. Reading that there are Russian-made drones in the hand of Hezbollah that are harder to detect, makes me go mental.

Leftist Americans that probably never left the continent or learned about world history, are used to the fact that America and Canada have no ethnic identity. But that is mostly because american identity is an identity that was constructed pretty quickly through the 'new world' idea, not one that evolved and changed slowly over the course of thousands of years. So they don't understand the idea that a country usually represents a group of people with shared traits and history - a nation. They probably think of it as land and it's 'local government' that is governing it, for whoever decides to stay there.

Most countries in Europe were always ethnic, but due to globalization after the world wars, Europeans are more intermixed now than ever, and are mostly seen as one ""European"" group now. Add to that the huge amounts of Muslim immigration, and European countries are getting farther and farther from their original national identities. However, you cannot claim that for example the country of France is not a country of the French people. Even if france now contains many people who are not french and have nothing to do with French history, it is still a country that represents said ethnicity, history, language etc.. If you remove France and put there a new libertarian democratic country without such an identity, the french people that do have this identity are left unrealized, unfulfilled and unrepresented.

So why only when it comes to Jews, there is no place for a country that represents our ethnicity? Why are these people not offended by the fact that the French flag and hymn represents the french and not the Arab french citizens?",27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1chncql/the_madness_of_accusing_israel_of_being_an/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1chncql/the_madness_of_accusing_israel_of_being_an/l23pmaq

I swear there was a quote I saw that said, ""People woke up Oct 7th a leftist and went to sleep Oct 7th a conservative.""

I don't believe it in th extremes but I genuinely felt like every value I espoused with what I thought were the right side of politics was completely flipped on its head that day and Israel hadn't even responded.

I'm from Australia and seeing the celebration for hamas terror and the denial of sexual assault and it was from the people I thought were truly rational, compassionate, and good people.

I've completely removed myself from that sphere, and no one discusses any anything with me because they know im a Zionist and my girlfriend is israeli, but I always feel like I'm on edge about it.

But the very few positives I will say is that it's motivated me to study, I saw what was happening, and I wanted to learn as much as I could and it's made me question a lot of the political narratives I bought into.
I wouldn't have said I was radical, but I definitely was blind to a lot of things, and this has levelled me out.


I think it may have done the same for you to, and just understanding what's going on and doing the research is so so much more than what these people think they are doing on campuses and shit.

My partner always says that the best thing you can do is just to replace all the negativity with compassion, so if you have anyone in your life that is israeli or Jewish or in the same boat as u, just check on em and make sure they feel listened to.

It was a hard, ruthless, and dangerous thing for them to do. They were alienated from friends and family for helping Jews. They were demonized, persecuted, and their lives were put in danger. 

Despite all this, I wonder how many of them regretted doing so and how many would do it again. 

Tonight, I sleep next to my partner whose grandpa is a holocaust survivor due to a non Jewish man helping him.

My partner, unfortunately, had many other family members who weren‚Äôt so lucky. They were killed in concentration camps due to starvation and they were mercilessly massacred in the gas chambers.

I wonder, how many of them could have been saved if people at the time cared more about doing the right thing, rather than the easy thing. 

I am not religious, but my Christian friend in Haifa once said something from her bible (i am paraphrasing) ‚ÄúBlessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven‚Äù. ‚ÄúBlessed are those who weep and mourn, for one day they shall laugh and be comforted‚Äù. 

His family says a prayer every year for the man & his family who helped his grandpa escape. Once I started dating him, I joined too. We have a place where we give him flowers and rocks every year (Jewish tradition). 

We all like to think we would have been heroes during the holocaust. That we would be the people who hid Anne frank and her family. People now have a chance to prove what they would have done. Especially in the face of massive adversity and antisemitism.

My heart goes out to you. I know you are suffering and are being hated & punished for standing up to evil. You are in a horrible situation. Things are terrible, people hate you for doing what is right, and the world seems like it is against you. Your efforts at times may even feel useless. Many people in the same situation will obviously wonder: ‚ÄúWhy should I suffer when it seems it won‚Äôt make a difference.‚Äù 

Well, the love of my life sleeps next to me right now (admittedly snoring like a maniac) because someone thought it was worth it and thought that their actions made a difference.

Those were formidable years, and I remember being in university at the time, and it was at this point where people really were indifferent to you having those questions or thoughts about the Israel-Palestine conflict. It was just a natural part of coming of age. It wasn't as dangerous to have a fringe left wing view on it because it wasn't really the talk of campus. 

In the year 2024, this situation is way different. You've got social media being weaponized very heavily and a lot of new players in the game. I do not trust almost one single mainstream media source, and this includes NPR. It's a geopolitical game, and Wikipedia is an absolute wreck. I look at the academic papers being referenced in many controversial articles, and they're being nitpicked from obscure academic departments that I couldn't even identify on a college campus if you had me walk between buildings. 

I understand the massive humanitarian cost of this war is a complete tragedy, but I don't think anyone could have possibly imagined the size of the existential threat to Jews today. If you at all have Jewish lineage, I would expect you to take a pause on writing articles like this and buckle down on weeding out the threat of anti-semitism. I don't understand Bernie at this point. It's getting pretty nasty out there. We are taking it from right and left and around the world.

Arabic-speaking residents of Israel town hit by Hezbollah rocket that killed at least 11,"I posted this in another thread, but I think it should be here as well. This is a copy-paste from another comment of mine, as a Jewish Israeli.

I've spent quite some time in Majdal Shams. All the signs are in Hebrew, the residents speak perfect Hebrew, and they are extremely friendly. They send their children to Israeli universities and they hold respectable professions in many northern Israeli towns. For example, a good portion of the doctors and pharmacists in Kiryat Shmona are Druze from Majdal Shams.

And likewise, the Jews and the Druze in all other Druze towns throughout the north get along. I've served with Druze soldiers - in fact the only soldier that I've ever seen abuse a Palestinian was a Druze soldier.

The Druze of Majdal Shams there say very clearly that they do not take Israeli citizenship because if they are returned to Syria, then the Syrians will slaughter them. They refrain from citizenship not because they oppose Israel, rather, because they fear Syria. For that reason they still fly the Syrian flag from their homes! But they'll tell you clearly why.

The Druze are just as much a part of Israeli society as are the Jews. Nobody would ever say that they are a lesser people to be sacrificed - the assertion is absurd and reflects only the poster's unfamiliarity with the region.",175,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1ee1b7c/who_are_the_druze_arabicspeaking_residents_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1ee1b7c/who_are_the_druze_arabicspeaking_residents_of/lfbe49m

2024-02-27 15:49:55,Israel,Israel,1b1eb3n,kse13ug,Biden: Israel will lose global support if it maintains its ‚Äòincredibly conservative government‚Äô,"Israel had a left wing government for the first 30+ years of its existence and it still never got more support from Europe or the Arab nations and NEVER had support from even the U.S. itself. Not until after the Six Day War at least. 

Most of these said Arab nations have way farther right ultra-conservative theocratic governments compared to Israel. But we don‚Äôt see the same amount of ‚Äúconcern‚Äù from the West hovering over them now do we? 

In fact, Westerners themselves will protest to their own governments to leave them alone. Does the ‚ÄúHands Off Assad‚Äù protest movement ring a bell?

Anyone who genuinely expects Israel to ‚Äúliberalize‚Äù in order to maintain support should be prepared to also force its Arab neighbors to do the same AND completely cut them off from any aid if they don‚Äôt comply. 

How many leftist Israelis were killed between the First Intifada, the Second Intifada, and the 10/7 Massacre alone? Do ppl not realize all that bloodshed sent enough of a message to Israelis?? 

It‚Äôs all posturing and moving the goal posts. Even if a left leaning government was magically ushered in  tomorrow, the world would still find something else to bash Israel over the head with.

I saw a viral PP tweet bashing Israelis who were protesting the government in Tel Aviv: They don‚Äôt care whether Israelis dislike their government or not, all they want is for Israelis to GET OUT!!!! and leave everything they ever had or built behind to the Palestinians.

America and Americans do NOT have to blindly support Israel or even pretend Israel is above mistakes. They aren‚Äôt. 

If Israel wants its BEST and most VITAL ally to stay strong, Israelis at the top must stop thinking about self serving to protect their positions, and actually accommodate the Israeli people, including the Palestinians in many ways.

I say this as a Zionist. Israel will NOT survive alone. American ally ship is key, not because of weapons. It‚Äôs far deeper than that.

Flip flopping on Biden won‚Äôt make Israel stronger, and Republicans/Conservatives like Trump will only rile Israelis up with fake support and drop you when you need help. Be real.

Biden is flawed in many ways, but Israel should be thankful he‚Äôs not Obamna, Bush or Trump.

He's totally abandoned Israel.""","The stuff Biden is talking about are weapons that would not be delivered for months and would have zero effect on Rafah. But Biden is the only thing preventing a collapse of Democracy in the US. And without the votes, that will be lost. Trump has vowed to be.dictator. He has vowed to use the justice department to go after his enemies. He has vowed to jail the press. He claims to be above all laws. He used his position to enrich himself. Everything he has ever been involved with has been found committing fraud. 

So Biden is basically trying to prevent voters from sitting out the election in a way that does no harm to Israel. Unfortunately Israel is not doing a good job of explaining it's position. So all of the propaganda against Israel is growing. 

Here's what the anti-Israel crowd thinks. They think that Israel is trying to punish Gaza in retaliation for killed 1200 Israelis and kidnapping 240 people. They think this is a tit for a tat situation and that it has gone way out of balance. To them, Hamas killed 1200 people, and Israel killed 34,000 people in revenge. And if that were actually true, they would be right to be against Israel. 

Biden knows this is not true. But this is not about Israel. This is about the future of the US. And as good a friend as Israel is, no country is important enough to jeopardize the US. If Trump comes into power, he is going to remove the US from NATO. And then Russia can start invading more countries with impubity. Trump will not only allow Russia to take over Ukraine, he will help them do so. And Russia will continue moving into other countries. And then world trade will be in the hands of Russia. 

Trust me. My family used to be part of the Trump organization and my father was one of Trump's top people. It was corrupt to the core. It just happens that it's in Trump's best interest for the moment to be extra helpful to Israel. Because if he and Russia can get Democrats to not vote, then Trump can take over, and then Russia will be on the path to being the super power of the world. 

Backing Biden isn't about being for Israel or Gaza. It's about trying to save the US from becoming another Russia. If that means having to throw some extremists a few bones until the election, then so be it. It won't stop Israel from doing anything. It's purely a publicity stunt. Try to imagine having an election where you have to choose between someone who doesn't give you everything you want, and a guy who wants to bring Hamas into power. 

That's what US voters are dealing with right now. They aren't picking a candidate over Israel policies. They are deciding if we should keep a democracy or move towards a dictatorship.",98,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1co1m84/president_trump_what_biden_is_doing_with_respect/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1co1m84/president_trump_what_biden_is_doing_with_respect/l3bgicd

The phone call of their car being attacked by Israeli tanks is blatantly fake.,"What do you mean debunk? She was in an area that was evacuated months ago, for some inexplicable reason driving around in a war zone during active shooting.

The footage shows the car was hit by bullets and not by a tank.

They probably drove through a shootout and were caught in crossfire.

As far as the ambulance, it definitely wasn't coordinated with Israel. The article says the ""ministry of health"" promised the abulance service to coordinate with Israel. THe MInistry of Health is run by Hamas and definitely does not communicate with IDF over ambulance crossings.

Probably the ambulance got hit by a bullet, sparking a fire, or was run over by an IED or an Isreli mine.

It doesn't matter who killed her, it was a really sad story and the point is a family that was responbile would have evacuated their kid from the area of active hostility months ago. And at the very least, during a shootout, would have stayed indoors away from the windows, not gone for a family trip in a car.

Either her family is criminally negligent, or her uncle was a militant and wanted kids as a shield. Either way, it's sad what happaned and I hope it's a warning story to everyone to get out of the way and evacuate whne the IDF says too, instead of playing games with your kids lives.

In general my go to is to tell people... Gazan militants have tunels under schools, hostages in hospitals, they shoot from schools and civilian homes, they dress in civilian clothing and operate in civilian areas. They use child soldiers. Then, they ask us to care more about their children than thye do. It's absolutely illogical to assume the enemy will care more for your kids than you do. We won't.

By the way, Israel has a host of strategies it uses to keep civilian safe- air defense, bomb shelters in homes, schools, even playgrounds, civilian training to respond to wartime scenarios like search and rescue, EMT training, educating civilians about what to do in different scenarios, we even handed out gas masks to every single man, woman, and child mutliple times. We don't expect the enemy to care for our kids. We take care of them ourselves.

I don‚Äôt want to annex the West Bank / Judea and Samaria as a whole. Area A and B are fully Palestinians. They should remain this way. I am strictly talking about area C. Area C has 300,000 Palestinians. Israel needs  to decide what part of the map they need to create a strong defendable border. 

Exchange some communities if needed . Even by force. We can‚Äôt keep sit down and wait for the Palestinians to decide to make peace. It‚Äôs ain‚Äôt gonna happen.",265,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1b8f59o/saudi_arabia_slams_israel_for_trying_to_judaize/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1b8f59o/saudi_arabia_slams_israel_for_trying_to_judaize/ktovqz6

This sub used to be mostly against settlement construction as it's an inflammatory act that really doesn't accomplish much. Now, when literally anyone criticizes Israel, even for things you used to criticize your own government for it's ""FUCK THEM!"". Christ, do you guys even see the immature toddlers you've become?

You claim to be the side that wants peace and is in favor of a two state solution. Yet when Saudi Arabia had made it crystal clear that it's willing to recognize Israel as long as Israel recognizes a potential Palestinian state, you all go insane. Seriously, you guys need to start admitting that you don't want peace either. It's tiring having to constantly lie and make excuses for you. They don't want peace and neither do you. They won't ever recognize Israel and you won't ever recognize Palestine. You're one in the same - both sides need to be deradicalized at this point.

She was the gold medal favorite today, so her coming in 2nd is a bit of an upset -- but it shouldn't be. I'm still very proud of her.

And, of course, I have to give it to Brazil's Beatriz Souza.

2024-08-20 17:22:12,Israel,Israel,1ewpgfm,lj2lfji,Israel recovers bodies of six hostages from Gaza Strip,"I initially responded to myself above, but I think I should make it its own comment instead:

p.s. I work in the Holocaust sphere. If you've seen any testimony from released hostages, they've all mentioned they were constantly telling Alex to shut up about the Holocaust (Alex also worked in Holocaust academia). I'm upset that we'll never get to hear Alex's ""Easter eggs."" Alex specialized in Poland, I specialize in a Western European country, but here's my favorite cross-over ""Easter egg"" I'd like to share in his memory, because I'm sure he'd be tickled by it, per all the testimonies I've heard:

The main deportations of Western European Jewry to Auschwitz began in the summer of 1942. A lot of these early deportations were young, strong and fit people who had kept their strength since it was still very early in the timeline of the war. They were sold the promise that they were reporting to ""resettle the East"" (some land in Eastern Europe had been changing hands constantly for centuries, so it wasn't as bizarre as it sounds to us). We all know what was actually happening.

So did Organization Todt, who operated in Eastern Europe and was responsible for building the Reichsbahn. Todt often used locals as forced labor, and they were behind on their Reichsbahn project. So, the leadership improvised a solution: they knew that trains heading to Auschwitz passed through Cosel, which was a rather rural train station about an hour outside of Auschwitz. Organization Todt began holding up the trains that passed through Cosel, by gunpoint if necessary, and abducted all men between the ages of 15-50/55 to use for their Reichsbhan project. Auschwitz was just going to kill them anyway, so no harm, right?

Except Auschwitz was still building the camp and the transit camps in France, Germany, and Belgium had been specifically ordered to do their best to arrest and deport the specific skilled laborers that H√∂ss had been requesting. By the end of 1942, H√∂ss was beyond enraged because he felt like the commandants at Drancy, Westerbork, and Mechelen were purposely defying orders because Auschwitz was exclusively receiving trains full of house wives, children, and the elderly. It got bad enough that he took the issue high up in the party leadership (forgive me for not knowing exactly who off the top of my head) before the issue was tracked back to Todt. Until then, no one had a clue.

Todt kidnapped tens of thousands of Jews over the better part of a year before anyone realized what was happening. It's worth noting that those kidnapped by Todt had a better chance of survival than those that continued on wards; Auschwitz had a terrible typhus epidemic at the time (to the point guards were hiding from prisoners, going AWOL, etc., in fear of catching it! There's a micro-Easter Egg for you). The work with Todt was extremely taxing so the survival rate was still very low -- often 0.5-2% -- but a higher survival rate than the gas chambers.

It will never not be one of the most bizarre Holocaust ""Easter eggs"" for me. I'm sad we'll never get to hear Alex's -- maybe this was one of his, or maybe he'd crack up and enjoy it, too. So I wanted to share it in his memory -- I think he'd like that.",12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1ewpgfm/israel_recovers_bodies_of_six_hostages_from_gaza/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1ewpgfm/israel_recovers_bodies_of_six_hostages_from_gaza/lj2lfji
