But Ms Johansson said she and the charity had a ""fundamental difference of opinion"" over the company's base in Mishor Adumim, next to the Ma'ale Adumim settlement.

She stepped down as their ambassador saying: ‚ÄúI remain a supporter of economic co-operation and social interaction between a democratic Israel and Palestine.

But Hamas is rebuilding in areas the IDF has vacated, and 60,000+ Israelis have been exiled from their homes for almost a year.  

It's losing diplomatically.  The ICJ is about to issue arrest warrants to Israel; the UK, Germany, and U.S. have all stopped weapons sales to one degree or another; and states that used to be somewhat sensible such as France and Spain just supported a measure to ethnically cleanse 700,000 Jews from their home, make the Old City of Jerusalem Judenrein, and demand the withdraw of all Israeli military forces even without any peace partner on the Palestinian side.  

Meanwhile, the ""laws of war"" have been distorted in such a way that ""experts"" now insist that terrorist organizations hiding in schools and hospitals must enjoy immunity from attack, and that even the most precise counter-terror op in history (the Hezbollah pagers/walkie-talkies) is condemned as a ""war crime.""

resident of Lod tried to smuggle 9 illegal residents under the double side of a truck

Earlier today, our forces operating in the  Eliyahu crossing area ordered the driver of a suspicious truck to stop.  In response, the driver began trying to escape while driving in the opposite lane and hit one of the police officers who slightly injured his hand.

In response, the forces fired at the vehicle's wheels and then stopped the vehicle.  During a careful search and thanks to the determination and professionalism of the forces, 9 illegal residents were located behind a double wall.  The driver of the vehicle, a 50-year-old resident of Lod, was arrested and transferred along with the illegal residents for further investigation at the Central Police Department's central unit.

I‚Äôll make this very clear:
No one but the state of Israel has authority over the state of Israel ,because no one can guarantee Israel‚Äôs safety better than Israel, and most people don‚Äôt even have Israel‚Äôs safety and security in mind. This conversation cannot be held without you (or anyone else in your position) firstly stating that Israel has a right to exist and defend itself. Then and only then we can start talking about logistics.

World leaders took an advantage of Israel‚Äôs unfortunate situation while Israel was (and still is) at its lowest point, to prompt themselves up politically and morally. And to me it goes to show the true intentions of anyone who is so keen on getting themselves involved in this issue.

The fact that you can question the morals of the only Jewish state, but you won‚Äôt even mention the terrorism and genocidal intent on the other side says a lot about you in my opinion.

You very clearly say that Israel is obligated to ethnically cleanse itself of certain areas, without saying anything about the fact that Israel has evacuated these settlements in the past, and it resulted in the situation we see today. are you ignorant of that historical fact or are you intentionally avoiding it to frame your question in a way that will frame Israel as the perpetrators?

When you look at Israel through the prism of WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) critical theories and intersectionality. Through this wonderful prism I can easily make the claim that Ta-Nehisi Coates is white and culturally appropriates black culture and identity.

Just like they claim that Israelis are all white imperialist colonists, despite half of us originating from Muslim Arab countries that expelled most of us. Just like they claim that raising the pride flag by any Israeli is pinkwashing cause an 'oppressor' cannot be part of the LGBT fight for rights. So Ethiopian Jews are actually white and any Israeli gay is actually a heterosexual cisgender that just has sex with other men, sex that oppresses Palestinians and their right for self-determination, no less.

These aren't ivory towers, these are actually rockets that become more distant from earth with each passing year."," ... a bias he acknowledges when he recalls in his youth arriving at the conclusion that  the israelis were  white,  and the palestinians were  black.   when you look at israel through the prism of weird  western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic  critical theories and intersectionality. through this wonderful prism i can easily make the claim that ta nehisi coates is white and culturally appropriates black culture and identity.  just like they claim that israelis are all white imperialist colonists, despite half of us originating from muslim arab countries that expelled most of us. just like they claim that raising the pride flag by any israeli is pinkwashing cause an  oppressor  cannot be part of the lgbt fight for rights. so ethiopian jews are actually white and any israeli gay is actually a heterosexual cisgender that just has sex with other men, sex that oppresses palestinians and their right for self determination, no less.  these aren t ivory towers, these are actually rockets that become more distant from earth with each passing year.","... bias acknowledges recalls youth arriving conclusion israelis white, palestinians black. look israel prism weird western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic critical theories intersectionality. wonderful prism easily make claim ta nehisi coates white culturally appropriates black culture identity. like claim israelis white imperialist colonists, despite half us originating muslim arab countries expelled us. like claim raising pride flag israeli pinkwashing cause oppressor cannot part lgbt fight rights. ethiopian jews actually white israeli gay actually heterosexual cisgender sex men, sex oppresses palestinians right self determination, less. ivory towers, actually rockets become distant earth passing year.",487,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1gdcy26/im_a_jew_of_color_tanehisi_coates_cant_apply_us/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1gdcy26/im_a_jew_of_color_tanehisi_coates_cant_apply_us/lu0qdjz,42.83099415204679,0.8827,6.1903154058531475,3.780341196173184,1

Once you start comparing American race relations, Apartheid South, or European colonization of the Americas/Africa/Asia to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict, you are no where close to objective reality. 

The I/P conflict is really a symptom of the Israeli - Arab conflict that has been reignited by Iran and its proxies. 

The reality is that Palestinian refugee issue cannot be fixed without buy in from the other middle eastern nations. 

After all, it was the decision of Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Egypt to keep almost 2 million Palestinians as second class citizens. 

It‚Äôs also the Muslim world‚Äôs fault that they arm and fund Hamas and PIJ, but don‚Äôt fund other Palestinian organizations that would focus on building a future for Palestinians. 

This is because they are under the illusion that Israel is an occupying force. The problem with this illusion is that Israelis are the descendants of refugees and have no where else to call home. 

Israel is here to stay and until the Muslims realize that there will always be conflict. 

The Palestinians are caught between the Jewish people trying to survive in the land of their ancestors and the greater Arab/Muslim world giving them no other choice but to fight the Jews. 

That‚Äôs the truth that Ta-Nehisi Coates will never understand as rich westerner who views all issues through the lens of American Racial relations.

2024-06-09 15:10:57,Israel,Israel,1dbv20x,l7to96z,3 things Israel needs to do after the war.,"1.  The entire IDF needs to be restructured.  This includes dealing with ""open-fire"" rules and providing for cultural training and awareness.  In the US, they get lots of sheltered young people, especially from working and lower middle class.  They understand that Bubba from Alabama doesn't have any experience with the Middle East so they provide that training before they ship him overseas.  Mad Dog Mattis made the entire Marine Corps take such a class prior to shipping them to Iraq.  There needs to be a similar class for all the IDF which doesn't seem to be happening likely because of political considerations.

2.   The education system needs to be dealt with.  Israelis should be provided with exposure to their entire society and should grow up with a shared narrative.  It's baffling to me that many Arabs haven't visited Yad Vashem and many Jews haven't visited some of the prominent Christian shrines or a mosque.  The ""tribes"" should be together in schools as much as possible and Arabic and Hebrew should be taught.  Students needs to also be exposed to the ""warts"" in Israeli history and Israeli society, not just the nice patriotic narrative.  It's similar to the US discussing slavery and Jim Crow and Germany reckoning with Nazism.

3.  The extremist settlers need to be dealt with.  There needs to be arrests of those who commit pogroms against the Palestinians.  The schools that cater to the haradal need to be investigated for teaching extremism and violence.  Those boys who attack Palestinians in the Old City during the Flag Parade are there with their schools, who aren't disciplining them.

4.  There needs to be a written constitution to work through all the various controversies in Israeli society.  There was a proposal in the spring of 2023 during the judicial reform protests for a constituent assembly to draft such a constitution.

5.  There needs to be a settlement freeze.  It can be done in conjunction of the Saudi deal.  Steps should be taken to ""thin out"" the settlements through population attrition.  I understand the deep skepticism people have about a Palestinian state but this will keep the door open to negotiations in the long-term.  Also, not having settlements there will allow the IDF to focus on terrorism, not guarding the settlers, and would minimize points of friction between the Palestinians and Jews.","1.  the entire idf needs to be restructured.  this includes dealing with  open fire  rules and providing for cultural training and awareness.  in the us, they get lots of sheltered young people, especially from working and lower middle class.  they understand that bubba from alabama doesn t have any experience with the middle east so they provide that training before they ship him overseas.  mad dog mattis made the entire marine corps take such a class prior to shipping them to iraq.  there needs to be a similar class for all the idf which doesn t seem to be happening likely because of political considerations.  2.   the education system needs to be dealt with.  israelis should be provided with exposure to their entire society and should grow up with a shared narrative.  it s baffling to me that many arabs haven t visited yad vashem and many jews haven t visited some of the prominent christian shrines or a mosque.  the  tribes  should be together in schools as much as possible and arabic and hebrew should be taught.  students needs to also be exposed to the  warts  in israeli history and israeli society, not just the nice patriotic narrative.  it s similar to the us discussing slavery and jim crow and germany reckoning with nazism.  3.  the extremist settlers need to be dealt with.  there needs to be arrests of those who commit pogroms against the palestinians.  the schools that cater to the haradal need to be investigated for teaching extremism and violence.  those boys who attack palestinians in the old city during the flag parade are there with their schools, who aren t disciplining them.  4.  there needs to be a written constitution to work through all the various controversies in israeli society.  there was a proposal in the spring of 2023 during the judicial reform protests for a constituent assembly to draft such a constitution.  5.  there needs to be a settlement freeze.  it can be done in conjunction of the saudi deal.  steps should be taken to  thin out  the settlements through population attrition.  i understand the deep skepticism people have about a palestinian state but this will keep the door open to negotiations in the long term.  also, not having settlements there will allow the idf to focus on terrorism, not guarding the settlers, and would minimize points of friction between the palestinians and jews.","1. entire idf needs restructured. includes dealing open fire rules providing cultural training awareness. us, get lots sheltered young people, especially working lower middle class. understand bubba alabama experience middle east provide training ship overseas. mad dog mattis made entire marine corps take class prior shipping iraq. needs similar class idf seem happening likely political considerations. 2. education system needs dealt with. israelis provided exposure entire society grow shared narrative. baffling many arabs visited yad vashem many jews visited prominent christian shrines mosque. tribes together schools much possible arabic hebrew taught. students needs also exposed warts israeli history israeli society, nice patriotic narrative. similar us discussing slavery jim crow germany reckoning nazism. 3. extremist settlers need dealt with. needs arrests commit pogroms palestinians. schools cater haradal need investigated teaching extremism violence. boys attack palestinians old city flag parade schools, disciplining them. 4. needs written constitution work various controversies israeli society. proposal spring 2023 judicial reform protests constituent assembly draft constitution. 5. needs settlement freeze. done conjunction saudi deal. steps taken thin settlements population attrition. understand deep skepticism people palestinian state keep door open negotiations long term. also, settlements allow idf focus terrorism, guarding settlers, would minimize points friction palestinians jews.",125,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1dbv20x/3_things_israel_needs_to_do_after_the_war/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1dbv20x/3_things_israel_needs_to_do_after_the_war/l7to96z,38.31015037593985,-0.9487,4.836281906951478,3.671482764812864,0

2024-06-09 16:21:49,Israel,Israel,1dbv20x,l7u010u,3 things Israel needs to do after the war.,"1. While I do agree, reality is that Its very hard to keep discipline amongst reservists so I am not sure how you want to do it exactly. either you send them to reserve duty often to enforce discipline - which is going to be a significant financial burden, or you babysit them - which is a manpower burden.  The Haredim conscript would actually help with this issue as if they behave like regular infantry it'd be easier to maintain discipline (but its a big if) and would require less reservists.

2. Israel is overly dependent on China, and detaching from it would be painfully hard probably too painful economically. no one would want to be the guy that gives that economic blow. as for Japan and South Korea they have their own games and goals. while they'd probably be amicable to an improved relationship with Israel I doubt they'd be an ally. not when if it will cost them friends trade partners in the middle east.

3. Russia is a loaded issue. there are too many Israeli-Russian ties, many of which are economic ties. For example pension funds of tens of thousands of elderly people who came from Russia have been essentially been frozen since the Ukrainian war and are being used by Russia as leverage to pressure Israel. You have people in Israel doing business in Russia and vice-versa. you have people with families in Russia sending funds to help their families there.","1. while i do agree, reality is that its very hard to keep discipline amongst reservists so i am not sure how you want to do it exactly. either you send them to reserve duty often to enforce discipline   which is going to be a significant financial burden, or you babysit them   which is a manpower burden.  the haredim conscript would actually help with this issue as if they behave like regular infantry it d be easier to maintain discipline  but its a big if  and would require less reservists.  2. israel is overly dependent on china, and detaching from it would be painfully hard probably too painful economically. no one would want to be the guy that gives that economic blow. as for japan and south korea they have their own games and goals. while they d probably be amicable to an improved relationship with israel i doubt they d be an ally. not when if it will cost them friends trade partners in the middle east.  3. russia is a loaded issue. there are too many israeli russian ties, many of which are economic ties. for example pension funds of tens of thousands of elderly people who came from russia have been essentially been frozen since the ukrainian war and are being used by russia as leverage to pressure israel. you have people in israel doing business in russia and vice versa. you have people with families in russia sending funds to help their families there.","1. agree, reality hard keep discipline amongst reservists sure want exactly. either send reserve duty often enforce discipline going significant financial burden, babysit manpower burden. haredim conscript would actually help issue behave like regular infantry easier maintain discipline big would require less reservists. 2. israel overly dependent china, detaching would painfully hard probably painful economically. one would want guy gives economic blow. japan south korea games goals. probably amicable improved relationship israel doubt ally. cost friends trade partners middle east. 3. russia loaded issue. many israeli russian ties, many economic ties. example pension funds tens thousands elderly people came russia essentially frozen since ukrainian war used russia leverage pressure israel. people israel business russia vice versa. people families russia sending funds help families there.",18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1dbv20x/3_things_israel_needs_to_do_after_the_war/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1dbv20x/3_things_israel_needs_to_do_after_the_war/l7u010u,35.25806451612903,-0.8713,2.9444389791664403,3.59066182596849,0

I don‚Äôt really question anything Israelis do with a clear mind to keep themselves safe. 

The reality is that Israel is a kind, idealistic nation that has handled its conflict with the Palestinians much more gently and respectfully than most nations have treated their comparable conflicts. Israel isn‚Äôt the country freaking out over hijabs. 

I think the challenge, though, is that the Meir Kahane wing has emphasized the old, not-so-wonderful parts of Judaism that treat non-Jews with disdain and views the perspectives of critics with contempt, and that has combined with the Sabra ethos glorification to promote aggressive rudeness toward dovish Israelis, Jews outside Israel and non-Jews. 

I remember reading 10 years ago about Jews harassing what I think was the *observant* granddaughter of my old Orthodox synagogue cantor because she wasn‚Äôt covered up enough by their standards. 

Here on Reddit, I see  streams of posts by allegedly pro-Israel people trashing all Palestinians, trying to mock any views that they or their supporters might have, trashing all leftists, trashing all U.S. Democrats, mocking any concerns about Palestinian civilians, etc. Those folks seem to be doing everything they can to alienate everyone to the left of Vladimir Putin.

Every Israeli I know is kind, polite and completely capable of acknowledging and understanding the unmet needs of the Palestinians. They want good things for themselves. They don‚Äôt want anything bad for peaceful, law-abiding Palestinians. 

 But Israel has let rude Israelis and rude Zionists make Israel look mean and rude. They have kicked Biden, for example, in the face over and over again. Then, when Israel has a bad day, and one person or one team is reckless and causes a catastrophe, the guy Israel kicked in the face over and over surprisingly decides not to go out of his way to defend Israel and point out that mistakes happen and jerks can show up and be jerks in any society. 

Along the same lines, Israel has, for example, killed, trashed and/or excluded  journalists from places like CNN who might be biased against Israel but who could also sometimes verify Israel‚Äôs side.

Shutting out somewhat hostile journalists might feel good, but it means that world news mainly shows reports from the friends of Hamas. Instead of getting media coverage that‚Äôs 70 percent hostile, Israel gets coverage that‚Äôs 95 percent hostile.","i m a jewish zionist who lives outside israel, loves israel, believes hamas did terrible things on oct. 7 and wants israel to win   i don t really question anything israelis do with a clear mind to keep themselves safe.   the reality is that israel is a kind, idealistic nation that has handled its conflict with the palestinians much more gently and respectfully than most nations have treated their comparable conflicts. israel isn t the country freaking out over hijabs.   i think the challenge, though, is that the meir kahane wing has emphasized the old, not so wonderful parts of judaism that treat non jews with disdain and views the perspectives of critics with contempt, and that has combined with the sabra ethos glorification to promote aggressive rudeness toward dovish israelis, jews outside israel and non jews.   i remember reading 10 years ago about jews harassing what i think was the  observant  granddaughter of my old orthodox synagogue cantor because she wasn t covered up enough by their standards.   here on reddit, i see  streams of posts by allegedly pro israel people trashing all palestinians, trying to mock any views that they or their supporters might have, trashing all leftists, trashing all u.s. democrats, mocking any concerns about palestinian civilians, etc. those folks seem to be doing everything they can to alienate everyone to the left of vladimir putin.  every israeli i know is kind, polite and completely capable of acknowledging and understanding the unmet needs of the palestinians. they want good things for themselves. they don t want anything bad for peaceful, law abiding palestinians.    but israel has let rude israelis and rude zionists make israel look mean and rude. they have kicked biden, for example, in the face over and over again. then, when israel has a bad day, and one person or one team is reckless and causes a catastrophe, the guy israel kicked in the face over and over surprisingly decides not to go out of his way to defend israel and point out that mistakes happen and jerks can show up and be jerks in any society.   along the same lines, israel has, for example, killed, trashed and or excluded  journalists from places like cnn who might be biased against israel but who could also sometimes verify israel s side.  shutting out somewhat hostile journalists might feel good, but it means that world news mainly shows reports from the friends of hamas. instead of getting media coverage that s 70 percent hostile, israel gets coverage that s 95 percent hostile.","jewish zionist lives outside israel, loves israel, believes hamas terrible things oct. 7 wants israel win really question anything israelis clear mind keep safe. reality israel kind, idealistic nation handled conflict palestinians much gently respectfully nations treated comparable conflicts. israel country freaking hijabs. think challenge, though, meir kahane wing emphasized old, wonderful parts judaism treat non jews disdain views perspectives critics contempt, combined sabra ethos glorification promote aggressive rudeness toward dovish israelis, jews outside israel non jews. remember reading 10 years ago jews harassing think observant granddaughter old orthodox synagogue cantor covered enough standards. reddit, see streams posts allegedly pro israel people trashing palestinians, trying mock views supporters might have, trashing leftists, trashing u.s. democrats, mocking concerns palestinian civilians, etc. folks seem everything alienate everyone left vladimir putin. every israeli know kind, polite completely capable acknowledging understanding unmet needs palestinians. want good things themselves. want anything bad peaceful, law abiding palestinians. israel let rude israelis rude zionists make israel look mean rude. kicked biden, example, face again. then, israel bad day, one person one team reckless causes catastrophe, guy israel kicked face surprisingly decides go way defend israel point mistakes happen jerks show jerks society. along lines, israel has, example, killed, trashed excluded journalists places like cnn might biased israel could also sometimes verify israel side. shutting somewhat hostile journalists might feel good, means world news mainly shows reports friends hamas. instead getting media coverage 70 percent hostile, israel gets coverage 95 percent hostile.",21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1buo5h6/head_of_aid_group_struck_by_idf_israel_better/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1buo5h6/head_of_aid_group_struck_by_idf_israel_better/kxvfoft,46.364714603409936,-0.9903,3.091042453358316,3.857877533835048,0

This is a perfect example of the allies showing concern for Israel by putting their internal politics at risk (UK and Jordan especially) and extending a hand in support for Israel.

There is nothing more to be done here with Iran. Israel should focus on an extensive build up of defensive missiles to counter the Iranian build up. Iran has many thousands of cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and drones. Israel has limited defense missiles, despite the amazing technology. Now isn't the time for this war. Israel needs stockpiles.

On the other side of this, it's time to work with the US and Egypt to shutter all smuggling tunnels into Rafah. That requires diplomacy, not an assault on Rafah.

I want the Rafah assault and want to see Hamas totally eliminated. But not at the cost of Israeli isolation. Hamas wants Israeli isolation because they'll fighting a guerrilla war for decades if need be. Don't give them that cover. 

Israel has a chance to change course diplomatically after last night. I want to see it happen. As Benny Gantz said, Israel will be fighting Hamas for decades. Better to maintain friends now and find peace in the region.

Our whole statement calling this suit blood libel, and entirely without merit, was completely refuted today. Along with it, also similar statements by our allies were refuted. The ICJ, including the US, French and Australian judge ruled that there is a plausible case for genocide. In doing so, it completely sided with SA by stating that there is a plausible case that there are genocidal acts being committed and with genocidal intent based on the many reckless statements made by our government officials. Siding entirely with SA on this point means that the court rejected our arguments that: our attacks are legitimate, the high toll of civilian casualties was caused by Hamas using human shields, that the we let enough aid in and that we follow international law. This is a devastating blow to be honest, I don‚Äôt think it was a solid strategy to appear in this case, but I don‚Äôt think we had much of a choice.

Regarding the measures ordered, it is good that a ceasefire wasn‚Äôt, but the rest of the measures mean that we must fundamentally change our approach to this war. This includes a complete overhaul of our rules of engagement to ensure being extremely careful with civilians and letting tons of more aid in. The court will also monitor our compliance with this in a month, so all eyes are on us. There‚Äôs no use of us saying that we‚Äôre already in compliance, because the court already ruled that we aren‚Äôt (that‚Äôs why it said there‚Äôs a plausible case for genocide).

The foreign policy under this administration on this issue has gone to absolute shit. They say one thing and do the complete opposite. They tell Israel to destroy Hamas yet put impossible obstacles in their way to do so, they say Hamas is the obstacle to a ceasefire yet put all of the pressure on Israel. It‚Äôs clear that they are more interested in domestic public opinion because of the upcoming election than actual competent foreign policy decision making. Moves like this make people like me (Israeli) who are on the side that think we should make huge concessions for a hostage deal even if it means Hamas stays in power because we owe it the hostages to become way more wary and negative on such a deal. Whatever the Biden administration thinks it‚Äôs going to achieve with this it‚Äôs just going to create the complete possible effect.

I'm from Europe, Christian-background (kinda agnostic though), I have been living here in Israel for 4 years.
It's been a while since I've taken to the social media and I've been reporting and exposing the lies against Israel.
These are mostly interactions with anti-Israel posts.

Because of how the algorithm works, my feeds in FB and Threads keep being bombarded with antisemitic shit (and it's not even veiled anymore).
On top of that, I had ex colleagues from Italy and family members buying into the Iranian bullshit. And I think that's what hurts the most - they value the lies they hear in the news, more than the value my words.

Add to that the stress of reading the news and wondering what's gonna happen. Some of the news really keeps me up at night - I know some are psychological warfare, but there is a part in me that believes there is more.

I also got to a point where I reached a burn out. I want to put away every social network and stop reading the news, in the hope it will go away. But I can't.
On one side I feel like I need to know what's happening, to be prepared. On the other side, I feel like I need to keep fighting back, because otherwise it's like admitting defeat.

Running to the shelter when a siren goes off is stressful. Reading that there are Russian-made drones in the hand of Hezbollah that are harder to detect, makes me go mental.

And then I'm in this constant state of being on the edge of crying, where I feel like just a little push is enough to make me fall to pieces.","i totally feel you.  i m from europe, christian background  kinda agnostic though , i have been living here in israel for 4 years. it s been a while since i ve taken to the social media and i ve been reporting and exposing the lies against israel. these are mostly interactions with anti israel posts.  because of how the algorithm works, my feeds in fb and threads keep being bombarded with antisemitic shit  and it s not even veiled anymore . on top of that, i had ex colleagues from italy and family members buying into the iranian bullshit. and i think that s what hurts the most   they value the lies they hear in the news, more than the value my words.  add to that the stress of reading the news and wondering what s gonna happen. some of the news really keeps me up at night   i know some are psychological warfare, but there is a part in me that believes there is more.  i also got to a point where i reached a burn out. i want to put away every social network and stop reading the news, in the hope it will go away. but i can t. on one side i feel like i need to know what s happening, to be prepared. on the other side, i feel like i need to keep fighting back, because otherwise it s like admitting defeat.  running to the shelter when a siren goes off is stressful. reading that there are russian made drones in the hand of hezbollah that are harder to detect, makes me go mental.  and then i m in this constant state of being on the edge of crying, where i feel like just a little push is enough to make me fall to pieces.","totally feel you. europe, christian background kinda agnostic though , living israel 4 years. since taken social media reporting exposing lies israel. mostly interactions anti israel posts. algorithm works, feeds fb threads keep bombarded antisemitic shit even veiled anymore . top that, ex colleagues italy family members buying iranian bullshit. think hurts value lies hear news, value words. add stress reading news wondering gonna happen. news really keeps night know psychological warfare, part believes more. also got point reached burn out. want put away every social network stop reading news, hope go away. t. one side feel like need know happening, prepared. side, feel like need keep fighting back, otherwise like admitting defeat. running shelter siren goes stressful. reading russian made drones hand hezbollah harder detect, makes go mental. constant state edge crying, feel like little push enough make fall pieces.",42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1g4drau/burnt_out_with_the_hate_against_israel/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1g4drau/burnt_out_with_the_hate_against_israel/ls2zp0y,30.647058823529413,-0.5689,3.7612001156935624,3.4546452161055683,0

Leftist Americans that probably never left the continent or learned about world history, are used to the fact that America and Canada have no ethnic identity. But that is mostly because american identity is an identity that was constructed pretty quickly through the 'new world' idea, not one that evolved and changed slowly over the course of thousands of years. So they don't understand the idea that a country usually represents a group of people with shared traits and history - a nation. They probably think of it as land and it's 'local government' that is governing it, for whoever decides to stay there.

Most countries in Europe were always ethnic, but due to globalization after the world wars, Europeans are more intermixed now than ever, and are mostly seen as one ""European"" group now. Add to that the huge amounts of Muslim immigration, and European countries are getting farther and farther from their original national identities. However, you cannot claim that for example the country of France is not a country of the French people. Even if france now contains many people who are not french and have nothing to do with French history, it is still a country that represents said ethnicity, history, language etc.. If you remove France and put there a new libertarian democratic country without such an identity, the french people that do have this identity are left unrealized, unfulfilled and unrepresented.

So why only when it comes to Jews, there is no place for a country that represents our ethnicity? Why are these people not offended by the fact that the French flag and hymn represents the french and not the Arab french citizens?","it s not hard to understand why they say that. leftist americans that probably never left the continent or learned about world history, are used to the fact that america and canada have no ethnic identity. but that is mostly because american identity is an identity that was constructed pretty quickly through the  new world  idea, not one that evolved and changed slowly over the course of thousands of years. so they don t understand the idea that a country usually represents a group of people with shared traits and history   a nation. they probably think of it as land and it s  local government  that is governing it, for whoever decides to stay there.  most countries in europe were always ethnic, but due to globalization after the world wars, europeans are more intermixed now than ever, and are mostly seen as one  european  group now. add to that the huge amounts of muslim immigration, and european countries are getting farther and farther from their original national identities. however, you cannot claim that for example the country of france is not a country of the french people. even if france now contains many people who are not french and have nothing to do with french history, it is still a country that represents said ethnicity, history, language etc.. if you remove france and put there a new libertarian democratic country without such an identity, the french people that do have this identity are left unrealized, unfulfilled and unrepresented.  so why only when it comes to jews, there is no place for a country that represents our ethnicity? why are these people not offended by the fact that the french flag and hymn represents the french and not the arab french citizens?","hard understand say that. leftist americans probably never left continent learned world history, used fact america canada ethnic identity. mostly american identity identity constructed pretty quickly new world idea, one evolved changed slowly course thousands years. understand idea country usually represents group people shared traits history nation. probably think land local government governing it, whoever decides stay there. countries europe always ethnic, due globalization world wars, europeans intermixed ever, mostly seen one european group now. add huge amounts muslim immigration, european countries getting farther farther original national identities. however, cannot claim example country france country french people. even france contains many people french nothing french history, still country represents said ethnicity, history, language etc.. remove france put new libertarian democratic country without identity, french people identity left unrealized, unfulfilled unrepresented. comes jews, place country represents ethnicity? people offended fact french flag hymn represents french arab french citizens?",27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1chncql/the_madness_of_accusing_israel_of_being_an/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1chncql/the_madness_of_accusing_israel_of_being_an/l23pmaq,46.78324081416865,0.6449,3.332204510175204,3.866674967436904,1

I swear there was a quote I saw that said, ""People woke up Oct 7th a leftist and went to sleep Oct 7th a conservative.""

I don't believe it in th extremes but I genuinely felt like every value I espoused with what I thought were the right side of politics was completely flipped on its head that day and Israel hadn't even responded.

I'm from Australia and seeing the celebration for hamas terror and the denial of sexual assault and it was from the people I thought were truly rational, compassionate, and good people.

I've completely removed myself from that sphere, and no one discusses any anything with me because they know im a Zionist and my girlfriend is israeli, but I always feel like I'm on edge about it.

But the very few positives I will say is that it's motivated me to study, I saw what was happening, and I wanted to learn as much as I could and it's made me question a lot of the political narratives I bought into.
I wouldn't have said I was radical, but I definitely was blind to a lot of things, and this has levelled me out.


I think it may have done the same for you to, and just understanding what's going on and doing the research is so so much more than what these people think they are doing on campuses and shit.

My partner always says that the best thing you can do is just to replace all the negativity with compassion, so if you have anyone in your life that is israeli or Jewish or in the same boat as u, just check on em and make sure they feel listened to.

It was a hard, ruthless, and dangerous thing for them to do. They were alienated from friends and family for helping Jews. They were demonized, persecuted, and their lives were put in danger. 

Despite all this, I wonder how many of them regretted doing so and how many would do it again. 

Tonight, I sleep next to my partner whose grandpa is a holocaust survivor due to a non Jewish man helping him.

My partner, unfortunately, had many other family members who weren‚Äôt so lucky. They were killed in concentration camps due to starvation and they were mercilessly massacred in the gas chambers.

I wonder, how many of them could have been saved if people at the time cared more about doing the right thing, rather than the easy thing. 

I am not religious, but my Christian friend in Haifa once said something from her bible (i am paraphrasing) ‚ÄúBlessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven‚Äù. ‚ÄúBlessed are those who weep and mourn, for one day they shall laugh and be comforted‚Äù. 

His family says a prayer every year for the man & his family who helped his grandpa escape. Once I started dating him, I joined too. We have a place where we give him flowers and rocks every year (Jewish tradition). 

We all like to think we would have been heroes during the holocaust. That we would be the people who hid Anne frank and her family. People now have a chance to prove what they would have done. Especially in the face of massive adversity and antisemitism.

Arabic-speaking residents of Israel town hit by Hezbollah rocket that killed at least 11,"I posted this in another thread, but I think it should be here as well. This is a copy-paste from another comment of mine, as a Jewish Israeli.

I've spent quite some time in Majdal Shams. All the signs are in Hebrew, the residents speak perfect Hebrew, and they are extremely friendly. They send their children to Israeli universities and they hold respectable professions in many northern Israeli towns. For example, a good portion of the doctors and pharmacists in Kiryat Shmona are Druze from Majdal Shams.

And likewise, the Jews and the Druze in all other Druze towns throughout the north get along. I've served with Druze soldiers - in fact the only soldier that I've ever seen abuse a Palestinian was a Druze soldier.

The Druze of Majdal Shams there say very clearly that they do not take Israeli citizenship because if they are returned to Syria, then the Syrians will slaughter them.

People for some reason always seem to forget Israel has a big minority of Muslim-Arabs (<20% of the state) that live among Jews with the only big difference between the 2 groups is the cities they choose to live in.

So being a Muslim really isn't a bad or a weird thing in Israel...

Besides, you're a tourist - why would anyone have anything against Tourists? And again, it's not like you come from a hostile country that might scare some people like Egypt or Jordan... You come from Argentina, a very close ally of Israel.   

So I really don't see any possible problems here...

Not until after the Six Day War at least. 

Most of these said Arab nations have way farther right ultra-conservative theocratic governments compared to Israel. But we don‚Äôt see the same amount of ‚Äúconcern‚Äù from the West hovering over them now do we? 

In fact, Westerners themselves will protest to their own governments to leave them alone. Does the ‚ÄúHands Off Assad‚Äù protest movement ring a bell?

Anyone who genuinely expects Israel to ‚Äúliberalize‚Äù in order to maintain support should be prepared to also force its Arab neighbors to do the same AND completely cut them off from any aid if they don‚Äôt comply. 

How many leftist Israelis were killed between the First Intifada, the Second Intifada, and the 10/7 Massacre alone? Do ppl not realize all that bloodshed sent enough of a message to Israelis?? 

It‚Äôs all posturing and moving the goal posts. Even if a left leaning government was magically ushered in  tomorrow, the world would still find something else to bash Israel over the head with.

I saw a viral PP tweet bashing Israelis who were protesting the government in Tel Aviv: They don‚Äôt care whether Israelis dislike their government or not, all they want is for Israelis to GET OUT!!!! and leave everything they ever had or built behind to the Palestinians.

America and Americans do NOT have to blindly support Israel or even pretend Israel is above mistakes. They aren‚Äôt.

He's totally abandoned Israel.""","The stuff Biden is talking about are weapons that would not be delivered for months and would have zero effect on Rafah. But Biden is the only thing preventing a collapse of Democracy in the US. And without the votes, that will be lost. Trump has vowed to be.dictator. He has vowed to use the justice department to go after his enemies. He has vowed to jail the press. He claims to be above all laws. He used his position to enrich himself. Everything he has ever been involved with has been found committing fraud. 

So Biden is basically trying to prevent voters from sitting out the election in a way that does no harm to Israel. Unfortunately Israel is not doing a good job of explaining it's position. So all of the propaganda against Israel is growing. 

Here's what the anti-Israel crowd thinks. They think that Israel is trying to punish Gaza in retaliation for killed 1200 Israelis and kidnapping 240 people. They think this is a tit for a tat situation and that it has gone way out of balance. To them, Hamas killed 1200 people, and Israel killed 34,000 people in revenge. And if that were actually true, they would be right to be against Israel. 

Biden knows this is not true. But this is not about Israel. This is about the future of the US. And as good a friend as Israel is, no country is important enough to jeopardize the US. If Trump comes into power, he is going to remove the US from NATO. And then Russia can start invading more countries with impubity. Trump will not only allow Russia to take over Ukraine, he will help them do so. And Russia will continue moving into other countries. And then world trade will be in the hands of Russia. 

Trust me. My family used to be part of the Trump organization and my father was one of Trump's top people. It was corrupt to the core. It just happens that it's in Trump's best interest for the moment to be extra helpful to Israel. Because if he and Russia can get Democrats to not vote, then Trump can take over, and then Russia will be on the path to being the super power of the world. 

Backing Biden isn't about being for Israel or Gaza. It's about trying to save the US from becoming another Russia. If that means having to throw some extremists a few bones until the election, then so be it. It won't stop Israel from doing anything. It's purely a publicity stunt. Try to imagine having an election where you have to choose between someone who doesn't give you everything you want, and a guy who wants to bring Hamas into power. 

That's what US voters are dealing with right now. They aren't picking a candidate over Israel policies. They are deciding if we should keep a democracy or move towards a dictatorship.","the stuff biden is talking about are weapons that would not be delivered for months and would have zero effect on rafah. but biden is the only thing preventing a collapse of democracy in the us. and without the votes, that will be lost. trump has vowed to be.dictator. he has vowed to use the justice department to go after his enemies. he has vowed to jail the press. he claims to be above all laws. he used his position to enrich himself. everything he has ever been involved with has been found committing fraud.   so biden is basically trying to prevent voters from sitting out the election in a way that does no harm to israel. unfortunately israel is not doing a good job of explaining it s position. so all of the propaganda against israel is growing.   here s what the anti israel crowd thinks. they think that israel is trying to punish gaza in retaliation for killed 1200 israelis and kidnapping 240 people. they think this is a tit for a tat situation and that it has gone way out of balance. to them, hamas killed 1200 people, and israel killed 34,000 people in revenge. and if that were actually true, they would be right to be against israel.   biden knows this is not true. but this is not about israel. this is about the future of the us. and as good a friend as israel is, no country is important enough to jeopardize the us. if trump comes into power, he is going to remove the us from nato. and then russia can start invading more countries with impubity. trump will not only allow russia to take over ukraine, he will help them do so. and russia will continue moving into other countries. and then world trade will be in the hands of russia.   trust me. my family used to be part of the trump organization and my father was one of trump s top people. it was corrupt to the core. it just happens that it s in trump s best interest for the moment to be extra helpful to israel. because if he and russia can get democrats to not vote, then trump can take over, and then russia will be on the path to being the super power of the world.   backing biden isn t about being for israel or gaza. it s about trying to save the us from becoming another russia. if that means having to throw some extremists a few bones until the election, then so be it. it won t stop israel from doing anything. it s purely a publicity stunt. try to imagine having an election where you have to choose between someone who doesn t give you everything you want, and a guy who wants to bring hamas into power.   that s what us voters are dealing with right now. they aren t picking a candidate over israel policies. they are deciding if we should keep a democracy or move towards a dictatorship.","stuff biden talking weapons would delivered months would zero effect rafah. biden thing preventing collapse democracy us. without votes, lost. trump vowed be.dictator. vowed use justice department go enemies. vowed jail press. claims laws. used position enrich himself. everything ever involved found committing fraud. biden basically trying prevent voters sitting election way harm israel. unfortunately israel good job explaining position. propaganda israel growing. anti israel crowd thinks. think israel trying punish gaza retaliation killed 1200 israelis kidnapping 240 people. think tit tat situation gone way balance. them, hamas killed 1200 people, israel killed 34,000 people revenge. actually true, would right israel. biden knows true. israel. future us. good friend israel is, country important enough jeopardize us. trump comes power, going remove us nato. russia start invading countries impubity. trump allow russia take ukraine, help so. russia continue moving countries. world trade hands russia. trust me. family used part trump organization father one trump top people. corrupt core. happens trump best interest moment extra helpful israel. russia get democrats vote, trump take over, russia path super power world. backing biden israel gaza. trying save us becoming another russia. means throw extremists bones election, it. stop israel anything. purely publicity stunt. try imagine election choose someone give everything want, guy wants bring hamas power. us voters dealing right now. picking candidate israel policies. deciding keep democracy move towards dictatorship.",98,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1co1m84/president_trump_what_biden_is_doing_with_respect/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1co1m84/president_trump_what_biden_is_doing_with_respect/l3bgicd,26.169771461494143,-0.6099,4.59511985013459,3.3021050119746187,0

A proportional response would involve a deliberate and elaborate plan by Israel to gang rape a bunch of Gazan girls and women, parade them through the streets before jeering crowds, and hold them hostage as sex slaves in Israel. And to abduct a bunch of Gazan toddlers, school kids and grandparents and haul them into underground tunnels in Israel. ‚ÄúProportional response‚Äù would require Israel to send a bunch of suicide bombers into Gaza.

And to have ‚Äúdays of rage‚Äù to gin the Israeli people up with seething rage against Hamas. It would require Israel to hide weapons and explosives in ambulances, in hospitals, in civilian apartments.

The phone call of their car being attacked by Israeli tanks is blatantly fake.,"What do you mean debunk? She was in an area that was evacuated months ago, for some inexplicable reason driving around in a war zone during active shooting.

The footage shows the car was hit by bullets and not by a tank.

They probably drove through a shootout and were caught in crossfire.

As far as the ambulance, it definitely wasn't coordinated with Israel. The article says the ""ministry of health"" promised the abulance service to coordinate with Israel. THe MInistry of Health is run by Hamas and definitely does not communicate with IDF over ambulance crossings.

Probably the ambulance got hit by a bullet, sparking a fire, or was run over by an IED or an Isreli mine.

It doesn't matter who killed her, it was a really sad story and the point is a family that was responbile would have evacuated their kid from the area of active hostility months ago. And at the very least, during a shootout, would have stayed indoors away from the windows, not gone for a family trip in a car.

Either her family is criminally negligent, or her uncle was a militant and wanted kids as a shield. Either way, it's sad what happaned and I hope it's a warning story to everyone to get out of the way and evacuate whne the IDF says too, instead of playing games with your kids lives.

In general my go to is to tell people... Gazan militants have tunels under schools, hostages in hospitals, they shoot from schools and civilian homes, they dress in civilian clothing and operate in civilian areas. They use child soldiers. Then, they ask us to care more about their children than thye do. It's absolutely illogical to assume the enemy will care more for your kids than you do. We won't.

By the way, Israel has a host of strategies it uses to keep civilian safe- air defense, bomb shelters in homes, schools, even playgrounds, civilian training to respond to wartime scenarios like search and rescue, EMT training, educating civilians about what to do in different scenarios, we even handed out gas masks to every single man, woman, and child mutliple times. We don't expect the enemy to care for our kids. We take care of them ourselves.

2024-08-20 17:22:12,Israel,Israel,1ewpgfm,lj2lfji,Israel recovers bodies of six hostages from Gaza Strip,"I initially responded to myself above, but I think I should make it its own comment instead:

p.s. I work in the Holocaust sphere. If you've seen any testimony from released hostages, they've all mentioned they were constantly telling Alex to shut up about the Holocaust (Alex also worked in Holocaust academia). I'm upset that we'll never get to hear Alex's ""Easter eggs."" Alex specialized in Poland, I specialize in a Western European country, but here's my favorite cross-over ""Easter egg"" I'd like to share in his memory, because I'm sure he'd be tickled by it, per all the testimonies I've heard:

The main deportations of Western European Jewry to Auschwitz began in the summer of 1942. A lot of these early deportations were young, strong and fit people who had kept their strength since it was still very early in the timeline of the war. They were sold the promise that they were reporting to ""resettle the East"" (some land in Eastern Europe had been changing hands constantly for centuries, so it wasn't as bizarre as it sounds to us). We all know what was actually happening.

So did Organization Todt, who operated in Eastern Europe and was responsible for building the Reichsbahn. Todt often used locals as forced labor, and they were behind on their Reichsbahn project. So, the leadership improvised a solution: they knew that trains heading to Auschwitz passed through Cosel, which was a rather rural train station about an hour outside of Auschwitz. Organization Todt began holding up the trains that passed through Cosel, by gunpoint if necessary, and abducted all men between the ages of 15-50/55 to use for their Reichsbhan project. Auschwitz was just going to kill them anyway, so no harm, right?

Except Auschwitz was still building the camp and the transit camps in France, Germany, and Belgium had been specifically ordered to do their best to arrest and deport the specific skilled laborers that H√∂ss had been requesting. By the end of 1942, H√∂ss was beyond enraged because he felt like the commandants at Drancy, Westerbork, and Mechelen were purposely defying orders because Auschwitz was exclusively receiving trains full of house wives, children, and the elderly. It got bad enough that he took the issue high up in the party leadership (forgive me for not knowing exactly who off the top of my head) before the issue was tracked back to Todt. Until then, no one had a clue.

Todt kidnapped tens of thousands of Jews over the better part of a year before anyone realized what was happening. It's worth noting that those kidnapped by Todt had a better chance of survival than those that continued on wards; Auschwitz had a terrible typhus epidemic at the time (to the point guards were hiding from prisoners, going AWOL, etc., in fear of catching it! There's a micro-Easter Egg for you). The work with Todt was extremely taxing so the survival rate was still very low -- often 0.5-2% -- but a higher survival rate than the gas chambers.

So I wanted to share it in his memory -- I think he'd like that.","i initially responded to myself above, but i think i should make it its own comment instead   p.s. i work in the holocaust sphere. if you ve seen any testimony from released hostages, they ve all mentioned they were constantly telling alex to shut up about the holocaust  alex also worked in holocaust academia . i m upset that we ll never get to hear alex s  easter eggs.  alex specialized in poland, i specialize in a western european country, but here s my favorite cross over  easter egg  i d like to share in his memory, because i m sure he d be tickled by it, per all the testimonies i ve heard   the main deportations of western european jewry to auschwitz began in the summer of 1942. a lot of these early deportations were young, strong and fit people who had kept their strength since it was still very early in the timeline of the war. they were sold the promise that they were reporting to  resettle the east   some land in eastern europe had been changing hands constantly for centuries, so it wasn t as bizarre as it sounds to us . we all know what was actually happening.  so did organization todt, who operated in eastern europe and was responsible for building the reichsbahn. todt often used locals as forced labor, and they were behind on their reichsbahn project. so, the leadership improvised a solution  they knew that trains heading to auschwitz passed through cosel, which was a rather rural train station about an hour outside of auschwitz. organization todt began holding up the trains that passed through cosel, by gunpoint if necessary, and abducted all men between the ages of 15 50 55 to use for their reichsbhan project. auschwitz was just going to kill them anyway, so no harm, right?  except auschwitz was still building the camp and the transit camps in france, germany, and belgium had been specifically ordered to do their best to arrest and deport the specific skilled laborers that h ss had been requesting. by the end of 1942, h ss was beyond enraged because he felt like the commandants at drancy, westerbork, and mechelen were purposely defying orders because auschwitz was exclusively receiving trains full of house wives, children, and the elderly. it got bad enough that he took the issue high up in the party leadership  forgive me for not knowing exactly who off the top of my head  before the issue was tracked back to todt. until then, no one had a clue.  todt kidnapped tens of thousands of jews over the better part of a year before anyone realized what was happening. it s worth noting that those kidnapped by todt had a better chance of survival than those that continued on wards  auschwitz had a terrible typhus epidemic at the time  to the point guards were hiding from prisoners, going awol, etc., in fear of catching it! there s a micro easter egg for you . the work with todt was extremely taxing so the survival rate was still very low    often 0.5 2     but a higher survival rate than the gas chambers.  it will never not be one of the most bizarre holocaust  easter eggs  for me. i m sad we ll never get to hear alex s    maybe this was one of his, or maybe he d crack up and enjoy it, too. so i wanted to share it in his memory    i think he d like that.","initially responded above, think make comment instead p.s. work holocaust sphere. seen testimony released hostages, mentioned constantly telling alex shut holocaust alex also worked holocaust academia . upset never get hear alex easter eggs. alex specialized poland, specialize western european country, favorite cross easter egg like share memory, sure tickled it, per testimonies heard main deportations western european jewry auschwitz began summer 1942. lot early deportations young, strong fit people kept strength since still early timeline war. sold promise reporting resettle east land eastern europe changing hands constantly centuries, bizarre sounds us . know actually happening. organization todt, operated eastern europe responsible building reichsbahn. todt often used locals forced labor, behind reichsbahn project. so, leadership improvised solution knew trains heading auschwitz passed cosel, rather rural train station hour outside auschwitz. organization todt began holding trains passed cosel, gunpoint necessary, abducted men ages 15 50 55 use reichsbhan project. auschwitz going kill anyway, harm, right?

2024-05-29 20:35:59,Israel,Palestine,1d3lcb2,l687wbg,Genuine questions from a member of the pro-Palestine side,"1. Fake news. There is no ""safe zone"", there is a ""humanitarian zone"" from which Hamas has been firing rockets since October. The strike on Sunday wasn't in that zone. The fire was caused by Hamas munitions stationed near those tents and the number of casualties has been exageratted. What wouldn't matter is if all hamasniks disappeared in one shot, i.e. 40k+ people, because people would still be crying ""genocide"". The argument of ""creating resentment"" is nonsensical. You can't fight wars without ""creating resentment."" As for whatever it is that you think Israel has been doing for 75 years, stop and think for a moment about all the things Arabs have done in that time.
2. This is literally all fake news. White phosphorous is legal and hasn't been used against civilians. There is more food going into Gaza now than before the war despite a large chunk of Israelis opposing it. What do you think happened on October 7 and before? They murdered infants, children, civilians, not as ""collateral damage"" but ON PURPOSE. If the US was attacked like Israel, it would respond in a far more deadly manner.
3. Sure there are innocents that die, mainly because Hamas is using them as civilian shields. Did the allies kill innocents during WW2? Sure. Whose fault was it? The Axis. And yes the reason does matter, it is not murder. ""Completely unrelated to you"": it is not completely unrelated, Hamas is the government of Gaza and has full support from the population when it comes to attacking Israel. 
4. No, it's not wrong. Human shields cannot be used to prevent a country from fighting a defensive war. The analogy is flawed. Israel already sacrifices many soldiers on the ground to prevent as many human shields from dying as possible. 
5. Hamas won't release all hostages even if Israel ended the war today. The IDF is taking all measures that it can to avoid harm to the hostages. Despite this, some harm may come to them and likely has. This is a very difficult situation, more than you can understand. 
6. Have you questioned the right of any other country to exist? The concept of ""Original sin"" is nonsensical (and is yet another example of a Jewish element being distorted and used against Jews). Hundreds of thousands of Arabs didn't live in the Land of Israel for centuries. Arafat was half-Egyptian and born in Egypt. The displacement occurred after the Arabs launched a genocidal war and lost. The nakba - catastrophe in Arabic (named to take attention away from the Shoah - catastrophe in Hebrew) - was the catastrophe of the Arabs losing land to Jews, and only later has become about the descendants of refugees to fit into a humanitarian narrative.

2024-05-29 23:21:39,Israel,Palestine,1d3lcb2,l68yrmi,Genuine questions from a member of the pro-Palestine side,"Thank you for promoting a good-faith dialogue between the two sides. It is unfortunate that you get downvoted, in classic reddit fashion, just because people in this subreddit have a different opinion than you. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong - I disagree with almost every conclusion that you make in your post. I do however recognize that your questions make sense from a pro-palestinian POV. Also, I feel that others here have given a good answer on the Israeli perspective, and will therefore not answer your questions myself. 

Instead, I would like to point out the biggest obstacle to peace in the region from an Israeli POV - the arabs‚Äô accepting, sometimes even celebrating attitude toward violence against Israelis. Let me explain why this is so significant. 

Pretend that you‚Äôre an Israeli Jew. This means that you are very much aware of the history of your people. Ever since the Jews lost their own state, when the Hasmonean dynasty fell over 2000 years ago, Jews have not been masters of their own fate. This has resulted in countless of pogroms and exterminations. Thus, every Jew is painfully aware of the consequences of not having your own state. I strongly recommend that you read this [wikipedia article](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Jews), if you wish to understand the foundations of this fear. Do this before reading the following paragraphs, if you want to read them like an Israeli. 

These persecutions occured in every place that Jews have lived. They have been commited by Christians, Muslims, and Pagans alike.

After the holocaust, the christian world has confronted its antisemitism, largely marginalizing the phenomenon. Pagans barely exist anymore. Muslims, however, have never questioned their anti-Jewish sentiments in the same way. This means that most muslims do not recognize the need of a Jewish state. 

Instead, many muslims feel the opposite, that there should not be a Jewish state whatsoever. This attitude has existed since before Israel‚Äôs creation, which the arabs opposed in any shape or form. Thus, the muslim hatred towards Israel has little to do with events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The hatred toward Israel is unconditional and ideological. 

When Israelis are killed by Palestinian groups who seek to exterminate the state of Israel, it is almost never condemned by muslim leaders. This solidifies what many Jews believe, that despite agreements and peace deals, deep inside, the arabs want Israel gone. This makes it very difficult for Jews to accept concessions. 

The October 7 attack is the most painful example of this. Only one muslim leader has condemned the acts of Hamas, the king of Bahrain. Others have been silent, and some, like Erdogan, have even praised the group. This is even worse among palestinians, with polls showing a roaring support for Hamas. 

As a Jewish Israeli, making concessions becomes nearly impossible when the other side celebrates when you are killed, and seeks to eliminate you from the map. What will happen if the Palestinians get their own state? Will its people accept coexistence with Israel?

As of today, the answer is no. If Palestine was created tomorrow, Hamas would take over immediatley. This is what happened in Gaza when Israel left in 2005. If the same thing was to happen in the west bank, Israel‚Äôs very existance would be threatend. This is what every Jew is scared of. We know what will happen to us if we lose our only state. 

If a day comes, in which Palestinians would abandon their violent ways, peace would be so much simpler. If coexistence was the ambition of the palestinian people - we could have a two state solution tomorrow. However, no Israeli feels that this is the case. We all remember the celebrations after october 7. 

These celebrations hurt the prospects of peace in the middle east. Make us believe that you want peace. Condemn violence. Don‚Äôt celebrate it. As long as you keep doing it, Israelis will not want to create a Palestinian state. 

Your promotion of dialogue is the constructive approach that is so necessary, but also so rare. Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing, and maybe we shall have peace between our people one day.

2024-05-29 21:49:06,Israel,Palestine,1d3lcb2,l68k941,Genuine questions from a member of the pro-Palestine side,"‚ÄúWhether Israel has a right to exist‚Äù is not ‚Äúbesides the question‚Äù - it is literally the root of all of your questions. If you don‚Äôt believe that Israel has a right to exist then how on earth could you believe that Israel has a right to defend itself - the point of the whole war? 

I believe you are asking these questions in good faith but I would just like for you to reflect for a moment on how absurd and unique it is that Israel‚Äôs right to exist is a considered an open question. Do you think England has a right to exist? What about China? Or any other country on the planet? No other country on earth is deligimatized to the extent that Israel is. You imply the source of this delegitimization is the foundational sin of displacement of Palestinians. Was the displacement fair to the Palestinians? No. Was it justified? Absolutely. The Jewish people were exiled from the land of Israel 2000 years ago and since then have been the most widely persecuted and hated group across the planet. The source of our persecution was the fact that we were a minority everywhere we went - perpetually unable to defend ourselves against the majority. After 2000 years of statelessness the Jewish people collectively decided we‚Äôd had enough and returned to our cultural homeland - the land of Israel. In the 48 and 67 wars many  Palestinians were exiled, although many fled willingly as the Arab armies and Israeli fought. It‚Äôs not popular to admit but out of the great tragedies of the 20th century the Palestinian nakba is not in the top 50. 750k Palestinians fled or were exiled from Palestine. That‚Äôs terrible. But why weren‚Äôt they welcomed by the Arab countries which they fled to? The Palestinians are culturally, ethnically, linguistically, and religiously indistinguishable from other Levantine Arabs. Why weren‚Äôt they absorbed? Because the Arab countries knew that would alleviate the issue. By keeping the Palestinians as perpetual refugees (the only kind in the world, look up the uniqueness of UNWRA) the Arab countries perpetuate their suffering and their hope of reclaiming the land of Israel - the source of ALL conflicts between the Arabs, Palestinians, and Israel. 

In 1948 the Levantine Arabs and the Israelis should have swapped 750k Palestinians Arabs for the 850k - 1 million Mizrachi and Sephardic Jews living in Arab lands (all of whom would be exiled or flee due to persecution over the next 30 years).

2024-05-29 23:08:32,Israel,Palestine,1d3lcb2,l68ws9m,Genuine questions from a member of the pro-Palestine side,"This question may be in good faith but there are so many incorrect premises in them that it is like talking to someone from another planet. Which is, not coincidentally, the experience Jews everywhere are feeling right now as they wonder what happened to the world that made everyone decide the Islamist narrative is correct.

I'm going to ask you some questions as well because it sure would be nice to understand your point of view.

1. In the history of humanity, has there ever been a ""just war"" ? One where you could point to one side and say ""the deaths of innocents are awful, but in the end the world was a better place"" ? 
2. Hamas has promised to commit a 10/7 attack ""again and again and again."" Do you believe them? 
3. Do you believe that there is any action that was justified by Israel in response to the terror attack? If so, what would it have to look like for you to NOT consider it ""genocide""? 
4. The vast majority of Jews came to Israel (formerly Mandatory Palestine under the British, formerly a part of the Ottoman empire) to escape persecution. Often they were forced to surrender all their possessions in order to leave. This started in earnest after the May laws in the Pale of Settlement in the late 1890s and led to the much larger Jewish population present in Israel by 1948. Holocaust survivors also chose to move to Israel rather than return to countries where they had originally been from and were no longer wanted. They arrived in numbers that no other country would accept. What should they have done instead? 
5. During wars, people become refugees. Often there is not an option to return to their original homes. They require resettlement in order to begin to live proper lives. The UNHCR, an organization of 20,000 employees, takes responsibility for resettling / repatriating these refugees into other countries. Yet for 75 years, Palestinians remain refugees, and their refugee status is passed down to their descendants. A dedicated organization (UNRWA) of 30,000 employees has been responsible for providing them aid since 1949, but has no mandate to resettle them. Why is this arrangement in place? Why doesn't every displaced people have their own dedicated relief organization?
6. 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from Israel between 1947 and 1948, In the following decades, Arab countries in the Middle East violently expelled 950,000 Jews. Israel took those Jews in willingly, and the majority of Jews in Israel today are they and their descendants. Do Palestinians have options for other places to live? If not, why not? Does Israel bear more responsibility for Palestinians than the other nations do for Jews? Why?
7. Is Israel a legitimate country? Is your country legitimate? If the answer to these two questions is not the same, why? If your answer to both is ""no,"" why do you still live where you do, and what is your responsibility toward the people your very presence displaces? 
8. Why has antisemitism increased globally since 10/7?","this question may be in good faith but there are so many incorrect premises in them that it is like talking to someone from another planet. which is, not coincidentally, the experience jews everywhere are feeling right now as they wonder what happened to the world that made everyone decide the islamist narrative is correct.  i m going to ask you some questions as well because it sure would be nice to understand your point of view.  1. in the history of humanity, has there ever been a  just war  ?

You DO seem to be engaging in good faith, although I think we've all heard these talking points so many times that we are utterly exhausted with them, especially since we've been hearing them from a lot of people who ARE genuinely antisemitic, or at least from people who have adopted positions from people who aren't acting in good faith.

I have to go to work soon, so I don't have time to answer all of this. I think a lot of the points rely on false premises, to be honest, or a distorted view of what is happening. I'll pick some to start answering now, though:

4. Comparing the enemy's use of its own people as shields in a war to a criminal's use of citizens as shields during a crime isn't really fair. In a domestic hostage situation, the police's DUTY is to resolve the situation while protecting the civilians. Police exist to protect EVERYONE, and harming people should be a last resort for them if their own lives are threatened. In a time of war, the duty primary of the military is to protect ITS OWN civilians while attempting to achieve strategic goals. It should not attack the enemy's civilians for the purpose of killing them, nor should it engage in other actions that don't further legitimate strategic aims, but it also cannot allow the enemy to prevent it from achieving legitimate strategic goals by using its own civilians as shields. 

2. Israel has millions of people. If it faces an existential threat that could lead to those people being killed or enslaved under Islamist rule, then military action that results in thousands of dead civilians IS justified, as long as Israel isn't intentionally targeting civilians for the purpose of killing them. According to some recent research, it would seem that plenty of aid has been allowed in by Israel, and the primary problem is that Hamas goes out of its way to either steal the aid or prevent people from accessing it. I DO believe that the IDF is justified in stopping aid in areas where there's a high likelihood that it would be seized by Hamas to feed its troops, though.

>Specifically, the Israeli researchers found that on average, between January and April, 124 trucks carrying food and humanitarian aid entered Gaza per day. That adds up to 3,211 calories worth of nutrition per Gazan, per day. The World Health Organization [standard](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234938/#:~:text=These%20values%20are%20a%20blend,women%2C%20it%20is%202%2C200%20kcal.) for calorie consumption is 2,900 per day for average-sized men and 2,200 per day for average-sized women.¬†

Hamas openly declared in its founding charter that it wants to exterminate Jews. Hamas leadership also stated that they don‚Äôt intend to stop at Israel and that once its destroyed they plan to take over the world and install Islamic Caliphate and Sharia.   Hamas demonstrated increasing capacity to mass murder Jews in a very deliberate campaign of invasion, rape and mass murder of children, women and others. And committed to doing it again and again and again.  

Yes, eliminating Hamas in a densely populated area involves civilian casualties.  Particularly so, that Hamas and other terrorist groups embed themselves in hospitals, schools, mosques, etc and place missiles next to tents with civilians as soon as humanitarian zones are declared.

Given the above, what choice does Israel have? What would you do? Don‚Äôt you think that Israel‚Äôs government has an obligation to defend her citizens from rapie mass murderers committed to extermination of Jews?  What about the US government?

As you say, you are pro-Palestinian, and your questions make you seem like your top priority is the safety of of innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza. If this is indeed the case, shouldn't your main ask of the situation be that Hamas resign/surrender, stop using human shields, and give back all hostages? Do you agree that if that were to happen, the current war/aggression would stop? 

Do you agree that Hamas have killed, and continue to kill, Palestinians through human shields, those who they deem to be dissenters, etc.? Do you agree that Hamas has killed members the Palestinian Authority and the PLO? Do you agree that Hamas is generally bad for the Palestinian cause? 

If your main concern is that so many innocent Palestinians are dying in this war, should your cause not be to get Hamas to end the war by way of steps I've given above?

Now, about Israel, I will keep defending this country‚Äôs existence for the simple fact that so many of you (propal) want it gone. 

For me, it‚Äôs not about the war, the suffering, it‚Äôs about making sure I‚Äôm not giving an inch to anyone who wants to destroy this country. 

War crimes, famine, targeting of civilians. All of this is despicable if proven to be true (and some of it is certainly true) but still I will not stop supporting the existence of this country and its people.

Because if we let terrorists get away with using human shields then eventually we will all be human shields. Moreover, Israel literally does everything in their power and more than any other military to avoid civilian casualties hence the extraordinarily low combatant to civilian death ratio in this war being fought in a highly urban environment with HUMAN SHIELDS. Which are the problem. 

5. Israel sadly doesn‚Äôt have the luxury to only retrieve their stolen loved ones but has to worry about the thousands of rockets being fired into Israel by Hamas, and Hamas continuing to repeat Oct 7 again and again as they vowed so they must balance the two issues. You have no idea the depth of the tragedy of that balancing act and frankly you should really humble yourself. Do not presume to care more about Israeli hostages than Israelis themselves. That is audaciously self unaware and arrogant and presumptuous and wrong on every level. 

6. Arabs were displaced by their own genocidal war toward the new state Israel. They rejected the partition that the Jews accepted that would have left everyone in their homes with literally no displacement. Once 5 Arab armies went to war with the beleaguered Jewish people who were still reeling from the Holocaust displacement naturally occurred. How about you worry about the 7 million Hindu displaced when Pakistan was created the same year. Also look up the Peel commission.  

7. You are speaking to Jews and Israelis mostly on this thread do not lecture us as if we haven‚Äôt been beaten over the head with these exact arguments for our entire lives. Humble yourself. IDF‚Äôs clear agenda is to protect Israel and Israelis. You have shown yourself to have a woefully uninformed view of this conflict so worry about your own edification before you worry about our lived experiences.

","It's cute that someone thinks the Palestinians will agree to a Palestinian state.
They will not agree to it for two reasons:
1. They will not agree to recognize Israel, sign peace, or accept Jerusalem.
2. They will not agree to give up their main profession: being refugees.

Disband UNRWA and present them with a fact: Jerusalem is not yours. Period.

It also appears in [Esarhaddon's Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esarhaddon%27s_Treaty_with_Ba%27al_of_Tyre) in 900 BCE. It's subsequently [mentioned countless times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_name_Palestine) by basically every group that every administered the region, under various cognates of the same name.

Also as some are saying in the comments, the etymology for the Greek cognate *Palaist√≠nƒì*¬†(*Œ†Œ±ŒªŒ±ŒπœÉœÑŒØŒΩŒ∑*), which is the version most used today, is not ""invaders"", but is a portmanteau of *palaist√™s*, meaning ""wrestler/rival/adversary"" as a reference to the [etymological name for Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_wrestling_with_the_angel) (""contends/wrestles with God"", referring to Jacob).

Not because of your final position, but because so few people shake themselves out of group think and take the time to do the homework and critically assess a topic.  

I have no data but my own observations of myself and those I‚Äôve worked with and known over the decades and the things I see in books and history, but I don‚Äôt think 1% of people have the skills you exhibited to be an independent and critical thinker who is also capable of acknowledging self mistake and changing your actual opinion. 

The best thing is that once you‚Äôve done it once on a topic, you‚Äôll find it easier to do on new topics and you‚Äôll eventually begin to approach new topics differently from the start.  You‚Äôll start to see red flags and cult like behaviors and group think manifesting in others, and you‚Äôll be quicker and faster at spotting charlatans and liars and false narratives.  You‚Äôll start to ask questions sooner and interrogate narratives faster (but not to fit in) but without fear of being left out.  You‚Äôll care more about the answers than who is offended at the questions. 

Only ‚Äúdownside‚Äù is you might feel lonely and realize how out of place you feel when you see how many people are drowning in group think and chasing clout at the price of losing integrity or critical thinking. You‚Äôll realize the majority is not usually right and that to be a critical thinker who can go against the grain will actually set you outside the group dynamic. Extroverts will feel it harder.  Introverts will embrace it. Those in the middle will feel it but I think standing alone to keep your intellectual and emotional integrity is the challenge.  

One that I would never trade.

With respect to who is indigenous, Jews are indigenous to the region, and, based on my lay understanding, so are Palestinians.

I have nothing against Palestinians as a people or as individuals.  I hope that we can one day live in peace.

Palestinians have built a National identity to the land. Jews are indigenous to the land as well. It's not sum zero hence a 2SS is valid. Just like in Canada and the USA different nations of people can have overlapping existence....

Absolutely not! Hamas broke the ceasefire as they always do.

I don't really think about anymore or less and Lebanon, Saudis or any other Arab Islam country... they're a people. I guess politically I believe they are unfortunately being used as pawns in a geopolitical war and I pity that... It's terrible.

2024-01-13 00:07:44,Israel,Palestine,1954f6h,khlj3zg,Questions from a ‚Äúpro-Palestine Jew‚Äù: starting to realize I‚Äôm in the wrong,"Hey there fellow Jew!
First off, nothing you've said about your previous 'blind' belief to the Palestinian narrative is stupid.
Humane people of all backgrounds can fall quite easily to this kind of propaganda, which so easily plays into our overly simplistic pattern of thought regarding conflicts - oppressors vs oppressed, powerful vs. underdogs etc.
It should also be mentioned that some aspects of the Palestinian narrative hold some sort of truth -- there's a reason it caught up so well in the Western society;
*""The best lies contain within them nuggets of truth, enough to give a listener pause""* - J.R.R Martin.

To your questions:

>1. Are Palestinian people the native/indigenous people of this land? If not then who is?

The piece of land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea was known throughout history in many names. 
Palestine is the most recent, but even Arabs in the region widely opposed this name up until the 19th century.  
It was considered, throughout history, as the southern part of Syria. The Palestinian national identity only formed in the 1880s, as a direct result of Zionism.
A good example for it would be that from 1948 to 1967, the WB was ruled by Jordan and Gaza by Egypt.
So when you ask about the Palestinian people, you're assuming a coherent Palestinian identity in the first place, which was not the case until very recently (historically speaking).

I will humor this question however; the people that call themselves Palestinians today are indigenous Arabs.
Some of them from the area of the Levant, some from the Sahara, some from the West Bank.
The lifestyle of the past millenia is nomadic, meaning people often didn't stay in the same place for many generations (specifically in this part of the world) - so immigration from one area to another was very common.
It should also be mentioned that many of current Palestinians are direct descendants of Jews that converted to Christianity and later to Islam. 

What indigenous really means? What is the cutoff for length of stay in a land that renders one indigenous? 
It's easy to distinguish Native Americans to be indigenous to America (or Aboriginals to Australia) because it's a continent in which they formed seperate civilizations throught ages.

So, to sum up, this question is a complex ethnogeographic one, and its wording harbors a basic rhetoric fallacy - the question itself is pretty irrelevant considering the nature of the words that form it (indigenous and Palestinian).
I'd say more about why it's so irrelevant in the answer to your next questions, I assume.
Possession of land is very complex and is completely subjective. I do not believe the Arabs have an exclusive right to this land, arguably not even partial right more than the Jews.
*There is not an acre of ground on the globe that is in possession of its rightful owner, or that has not been taken away from owner after owner, cycle afer cycle, by force and bloodshed.* - Mark Twain.

>2. Is it true that Israel refused to take back the hostages?

Hamas has said it will free the hostages when Israel's aggression will stop.
In the scope of this conflict, it means Israel has to completely withdraw from the Gaza Strip, shut down its operation and let Hamas build infrastructure again for the next deadly massacre.
In other terms: it means surrender of Israel to Hamas.
Not one Israeli will go back to live anywhere near Southern Israel if Israel agrees to this deadly deal.

>3. What are your personal feelings about the people of Palestine? Not Hamas or their supporters, but ordinary people who happen to live there.

I was raised to judge people for who they are, and that the value of life is above everything else.
Even though the Palestinian flag is the flag of a terrorist organization that killed hundreds of Israelis, and the Palestinian charther and anthem calls for the eradication of Israel, and that Palestinian leaders endorse and promote killing of Israelis and genocidal agendas -- **I still think Palestinian are good people**.
They are merely the victims of the Arab world, which chooses to help them resist, die and suffer and not to prosper (this is the root of their problem and this conflict, I can explain more on that if you'd want).
Palestinian individuals mostly want to kill or cleanse all Israelis, which makes them quite hard to like, but they often keep their opinions to themselves so it's OK.
I know how deeply indoctrinated they are, and I know how powerful religion can be, so I don't hate them.


>4. This is for people currently in Israel. What has your life been like these past few months? I‚Äôve been told everything is beautiful and luxurious for Israelis.

Israel has 7 million Jews (approx. population of Arizona), condensed in an area smaller than the size of New Jersey.
That means each and every Israeli knows someone (a close relative or a friend) who was either murdered/taken hostage on October 7th or died in the war since then.
Yes, we have running water and food in our fridges.
But we still cry over the loss of 1,200 of our brothers and sisters in a massacre 3 months ago, we still think about our elderly that die in Hamas tunnels with no medical care and hunger, and our girls who are being continously raped by terrorists at this very moment.
We still have 120,000 people internally displaced in the country.
We all have loved ones who are risking their lives in the most dangerous place in world right now, Gaza.
It should also be mentioned that at the same time that we fight in 5 fronts here in Israel, we also face hate from billions of people around the world that truly believe we don't have the right to exist or defend ourselves.
So, no, life in Israel haven't been so beautiful in the past 3 months. It's in fact more like hell on earth for most Israelis, where the death and suffering of our people is present everywhere and everyday. 

>5. What can I personally do, as a student living in North America, to support Israel apart from spreading awareness?

Educate yourself on the topic as much as you can so can could have the informational tools to critically think and refute the murderous pro Palestinian narrative.
Spread awareness about the cruelty of Hamas and why it should cease to exist.
Point out that anti-Zionism is antisemitism, and it can't be labeled as anything else (you can read more online on 'new antisemitism').
If you can make one pro Palestinian see the hypocrisy of their claims, you've done more than most of us here in Israel can do.

Lastly, I'd encourage you to get into this intellectual journey completely unbiased. Let yourself form your own individual and unique opinion, objectively. Try to think as a researcher, not as an American, a Jew, or someone who had previously stood only for the Palestinian cause.
Let yourself ask the hard questions - where was Israel wrong? Where was Palestine wrong? Why were they wrong? Is this source credible enough? What am I missing in the broader context?
A good starting point for this journey would be to try to see the Israeli narrative for each Palestinian narrative you know about - and this way, to find the center; where there's nothing left but the truth, clean of any agendas and propaganda. pro Palestinian sources never show any of the Israeli perspective, which serves the radical hivemind mentality. There are plenty of Israeli scholars, however, that show both sides somehow neutrally.","hey there fellow jew! first off, nothing you ve said about your previous  blind  belief to the palestinian narrative is stupid. humane people of all backgrounds can fall quite easily to this kind of propaganda, which so easily plays into our overly simplistic pattern of thought regarding conflicts   oppressors vs oppressed, powerful vs. underdogs etc. it should also be mentioned that some aspects of the palestinian narrative hold some sort of truth    there s a reason it caught up so well in the western society    the best lies contain within them nuggets of truth, enough to give a listener pause     j.r.r martin.  to your questions    1. are palestinian people the native indigenous people of this land? if not then who is?  the piece of land between the jordan river and the mediterranean sea was known throughout history in many names.  palestine is the most recent, but even arabs in the region widely opposed this name up until the 19th century.   it was considered, throughout history, as the southern part of syria. the palestinian national identity only formed in the 1880s, as a direct result of zionism. a good example for it would be that from 1948 to 1967, the wb was ruled by jordan and gaza by egypt. so when you ask about the palestinian people, you re assuming a coherent palestinian identity in the first place, which was not the case until very recently  historically speaking .  i will humor this question however  the people that call themselves palestinians today are indigenous arabs. some of them from the area of the levant, some from the sahara, some from the west bank. the lifestyle of the past millenia is nomadic, meaning people often didn t stay in the same place for many generations  specifically in this part of the world    so immigration from one area to another was very common. it should also be mentioned that many of current palestinians are direct descendants of jews that converted to christianity and later to islam.   what indigenous really means? what is the cutoff for length of stay in a land that renders one indigenous?  it s easy to distinguish native americans to be indigenous to america  or aboriginals to australia  because it s a continent in which they formed seperate civilizations throught ages.  so, to sum up, this question is a complex ethnogeographic one, and its wording harbors a basic rhetoric fallacy   the question itself is pretty irrelevant considering the nature of the words that form it  indigenous and palestinian . i d say more about why it s so irrelevant in the answer to your next questions, i assume. possession of land is very complex and is completely subjective. i do not believe the arabs have an exclusive right to this land, arguably not even partial right more than the jews.  there is not an acre of ground on the globe that is in possession of its rightful owner, or that has not been taken away from owner after owner, cycle afer cycle, by force and bloodshed.    mark twain.   2. is it true that israel refused to take back the hostages?  hamas has said it will free the hostages when israel s aggression will stop. in the scope of this conflict, it means israel has to completely withdraw from the gaza strip, shut down its operation and let hamas build infrastructure again for the next deadly massacre. in other terms  it means surrender of israel to hamas. not one israeli will go back to live anywhere near southern israel if israel agrees to this deadly deal.   3. what are your personal feelings about the people of palestine? not hamas or their supporters, but ordinary people who happen to live there.  i was raised to judge people for who they are, and that the value of life is above everything else. even though the palestinian flag is the flag of a terrorist organization that killed hundreds of israelis, and the palestinian charther and anthem calls for the eradication of israel, and that palestinian leaders endorse and promote killing of israelis and genocidal agendas      i still think palestinian are good people  . they are merely the victims of the arab world, which chooses to help them resist, die and suffer and not to prosper  this is the root of their problem and this conflict, i can explain more on that if you d want . palestinian individuals mostly want to kill or cleanse all israelis, which makes them quite hard to like, but they often keep their opinions to themselves so it s ok. i know how deeply indoctrinated they are, and i know how powerful religion can be, so i don t hate them.    4. this is for people currently in israel. what has your life been like these past few months? i ve been told everything is beautiful and luxurious for israelis.  israel has 7 million jews  approx. population of arizona , condensed in an area smaller than the size of new jersey. that means each and every israeli knows someone  a close relative or a friend  who was either murdered taken hostage on october 7th or died in the war since then. yes, we have running water and food in our fridges. but we still cry over the loss of 1,200 of our brothers and sisters in a massacre 3 months ago, we still think about our elderly that die in hamas tunnels with no medical care and hunger, and our girls who are being continously raped by terrorists at this very moment. we still have 120,000 people internally displaced in the country. we all have loved ones who are risking their lives in the most dangerous place in world right now, gaza. it should also be mentioned that at the same time that we fight in 5 fronts here in israel, we also face hate from billions of people around the world that truly believe we don t have the right to exist or defend ourselves. so, no, life in israel haven t been so beautiful in the past 3 months. it s in fact more like hell on earth for most israelis, where the death and suffering of our people is present everywhere and everyday.    5. what can i personally do, as a student living in north america, to support israel apart from spreading awareness?  educate yourself on the topic as much as you can so can could have the informational tools to critically think and refute the murderous pro palestinian narrative. spread awareness about the cruelty of hamas and why it should cease to exist. point out that anti zionism is antisemitism, and it can t be labeled as anything else  you can read more online on  new antisemitism  . if you can make one pro palestinian see the hypocrisy of their claims, you ve done more than most of us here in israel can do.  lastly, i d encourage you to get into this intellectual journey completely unbiased. let yourself form your own individual and unique opinion, objectively. try to think as a researcher, not as an american, a jew, or someone who had previously stood only for the palestinian cause. let yourself ask the hard questions   where was israel wrong?

Palestine is a European name invented by Europeans. The Palestinian flag was designed by a British Imperialist to evoke the Arab Caliphates (colonialist empires). Palestinians speak Arabic, a language from Arabia, not the Levant. Arabs are (mostly) Muslim, a religion from Arabia. Some are Christian, a religion that - while it worships a Jew born in the Land of Israel - was really codified in Europe and Turkie.","re  the indigenous people  jews. jews  and samaritans, an offshoot of jews  are the indigenous people.    a good place to start      palestine is a european name invented by europeans. the palestinian flag was designed by a british imperialist to evoke the arab caliphates  colonialist empires . palestinians speak arabic, a language from arabia, not the levant. arabs are  mostly  muslim, a religion from arabia. some are christian, a religion that   while it worships a jew born in the land of israel   was really codified in europe and turkie.","indigenous people jews. jews samaritans, offshoot jews indigenous people. good place start palestine european name invented europeans. palestinian flag designed british imperialist evoke arab caliphates colonialist empires . palestinians speak arabic, language arabia, levant. arabs mostly muslim, religion arabia. christian, religion worships jew born land israel really codified europe turkie.",23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1954f6h/questions_from_a_propalestine_jew_starting_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1954f6h/questions_from_a_propalestine_jew_starting_to/khlfbpv,37.71592775041052,0.6486,3.1780538303479458,3.656251085142176,1
2024-01-12 23:51:15,Israel,Palestine,1954f6h,khlgkm1,Questions from a ‚Äúpro-Palestine Jew‚Äù: starting to realize I‚Äôm in the wrong,"First, I am going to guess that you live in Canada, probably Montreal or Toronto (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but the most outrageous things I‚Äôve seen in North America come from there).

I‚Äôm going to reply with my experience because I think it‚Äôs better for every Jew to make his/her way back to the community in their own way. The only important thing is that you understand that when people tell you that as a Jew you should hide, they are antisemitic. When they don‚Äôt even acknowledge that some Jews may have different opinions and cancel them just because of being Jewish, they are antisemitic. And you know, when they come for Jews, no other identity or characteristic matters, that‚Äôs what I take away from the Shoah.

I was educated in a very Zionist school founded by Shoah survivors. I felt my education as indoctrination. I thought that they expected us to support Israel uncritically, regardless of the party in power (clearly as I was always left-leaning I found it harder and harder to support Sharon or Netanyahu), because without Israel there would be no Jews.

My mother always told me that Arabs hate us, but as a good rebel I made Arab friends from Syria and Egypt to try. It was all good and rosy until Oct 7 and until I started expressing that ‚Äúhey my family and friends in Israel could have been killed by Hamas, why are people posting shit about free Palestine or justifying the attacks instead of asking me how my family is doing‚Äù. Of course my Arab friends blocked me for simply being Jewish, so I kinda have to give it to my mom.

Anyway, after Oct 7 I realized that, while my education was a bit flawed in that Israel is a country that can make wrong political choices, we need it to exist because the antisemitic bigots are everywhere and I personally don‚Äôt want to be harassed or discriminated simply for my ethnicity. So I am happy to know there is a country where my family and I can go to seek refuge.","first, i am going to guess that you live in canada, probably montreal or toronto  correct me if i m wrong, but the most outrageous things i ve seen in north america come from there .  i m going to reply with my experience because i think it s better for every jew to make his her way back to the community in their own way. the only important thing is that you understand that when people tell you that as a jew you should hide, they are antisemitic. when they don t even acknowledge that some jews may have different opinions and cancel them just because of being jewish, they are antisemitic. and you know, when they come for jews, no other identity or characteristic matters, that s what i take away from the shoah.  i was educated in a very zionist school founded by shoah survivors. i felt my education as indoctrination. i thought that they expected us to support israel uncritically, regardless of the party in power  clearly as i was always left leaning i found it harder and harder to support sharon or netanyahu , because without israel there would be no jews.  my mother always told me that arabs hate us, but as a good rebel i made arab friends from syria and egypt to try. it was all good and rosy until oct 7 and until i started expressing that  hey my family and friends in israel could have been killed by hamas, why are people posting shit about free palestine or justifying the attacks instead of asking me how my family is doing . of course my arab friends blocked me for simply being jewish, so i kinda have to give it to my mom.  anyway, after oct 7 i realized that, while my education was a bit flawed in that israel is a country that can make wrong political choices, we need it to exist because the antisemitic bigots are everywhere and i personally don t want to be harassed or discriminated simply for my ethnicity. so i am happy to know there is a country where my family and i can go to seek refuge.","first, going guess live canada, probably montreal toronto correct wrong, outrageous things seen north america come . going reply experience think better every jew make way back community way. important thing understand people tell jew hide, antisemitic. even acknowledge jews may different opinions cancel jewish, antisemitic. know, come jews, identity characteristic matters, take away shoah. educated zionist school founded shoah survivors. felt education indoctrination. thought expected us support israel uncritically, regardless party power clearly always left leaning found harder harder support sharon netanyahu , without israel would jews. mother always told arabs hate us, good rebel made arab friends syria egypt try. good rosy oct 7 started expressing hey family friends israel could killed hamas, people posting shit free palestine justifying attacks instead asking family . course arab friends blocked simply jewish, kinda give mom. anyway, oct 7 realized that, education bit flawed israel country make wrong political choices, need exist antisemitic bigots everywhere personally want harassed discriminated simply ethnicity. happy know country family go seek refuge.",24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1954f6h/questions_from_a_propalestine_jew_starting_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1954f6h/questions_from_a_propalestine_jew_starting_to/khlgkm1,44.66673769443853,-0.3386,3.2188758248682006,3.8213701925114743,0
2024-01-13 00:09:01,Israel,Palestine,1954f6h,khljb2v,Questions from a ‚Äúpro-Palestine Jew‚Äù: starting to realize I‚Äôm in the wrong,"1) Jews were always indigenous to this land - genetic tests prove that we are genetically closer to each other and to other levantine peoples, than we are to the people in the countries that we left when immigrating to Israel (because holocaust, pogroms...). Palestinians also have levantine genetics mostly, but there was no such thing as ""Palestinians"" when Israel came to be. There were many unrelated Arab tribes, levantine people that were arabized during Arab colonialism, and a lot of empty land. There were also many Jews still in the land of Israel, many generations before '48, so it's not like these lands were uniquely Arab. The Palestinian identity and nationality was artificially created in the sixties, only to unite the Arabs against the so-called [""evil Zionist entity""](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionist_entity). There are other peoples indigenous to the levantine, for example the Druze - do you see them making any trouble?
2) After Hamas was done releasing children and mothers along with some of the elderly (except for the Bibas family, which they claim are dead, but the IDF says there is no basis to these claims), Hamas was supposed to start releasing the women and the rest of the elderly. They didn't want to release the women, they wanted to release only the elderly + some dead hostages. This is after Hamas broke the ceasefire multiple times and ""played games"" too many times with the hostage deal. Israel said that we're not playing their games anymore and announced the return to war. This didn't break the deal as the ceasefire was temporary and it was always stated that the war will continue after the swap ends. Hamas could lengthen the ceasefire by one day for every 10 more hostages released - the ceasefire was longer than the term of the original agreement.
3) I don't hate Palestinians, I feel bad for them. I hate that it has to be this way. Even those who think that Hamas are good, they have been indoctrinated to believe that from a young age. I do hate Hamas fighters, but more than that, I hate the pro-Palestinian activists like your friends, because they weren't indoctrinated, they always had full access to the true facts, yet they support terrorism. I don't think many of them went into it naively like you, many of them are fully aware of the facts, but choose the wrong side anyway, and silence you when you say anything else.
4) The whole country is still in trauma from the 7/10. Half of the country is in disarray because many were recruited to reserve duty, and their families have to make up for them at home. People were afraid to go out for the first month and a half, but we are starting to go back to some kind of routine. The university semester was delayed by months. Small businesses are closing... But besides the 7/10, yes, Israel is definitely more ""luxurious"" than Gaza. Israel is a normal country, because we use our money to develop. Gaza received tons of money, and it all went into terror tunnels instead of into development and the welfare of the civilians. I'm talking about Millions, maybe even Billions of dollars
5) I really don't know. Speaking up against pro-Palestinian activists may actually be dangerous, there are too many videos of them commiting violence against ""Zionists"" (sometimes Jews who never said a word about Israel)
6) I think watching Israel's defence in the ICJ genocide trial sums up a lot pretty well. But that's just the tip of the iceberg - scroll through this sub, as well as r/palestinian_violence, etc.

Hope it helps, glad that you came to realize the truth.

(Arabs colonised much of the middle east) 

2: Israel didn't refuse to take back the hostages. Hamas started playing games with giving them back almost immediately, and refused to give back all of the women. 

Even now, there are 13 women that they are holding hostage. The released hostages speak of sexual abuse, and there is a real fear of the remaining female hostages getting pregnant.. 

3: I think theyre tragically indoctrinated. Its awful that they live under an oppressive regime that brainwashed them. Its horrible that their government steals all their aid money to build tunnels and shoot rockets. That they dig up water pipes for the same purpose.

4:I don't live there right now. I imagine people within rocket distance are anxious and suffering PTSD from hamas's indiscriminate bombing. I know there have been studies of Israeli children specifically in regards to PTSD

5: donating to Zaka or a similar organization would be helpful. The horrors they saw as they were identifying the bodies is unimaginable. 

6: I'll provide links to specifics of what I mentioned (other comments provided youtube channels and books), shortly.

Their resounding silence of crises¬†and atrocities¬†going on across the world, some for decades is proof enough of that. I saw no such mass protests and passion for the genocide of the Uighurs, Kurds, Assyrians, Sudanese, and many more.

The vast majority of pro Palestinian protesters we have seen these last few months know very little about the realities on the ground for Palestinians nor do they care beyond their TikTok clout. They chant and say things they see on Instagram but have taken very little effort to understand the complex realities here beyond the 2 min videos they watch on TikTok.

Almost all of them talk out their asses with a mix of ignorance, racism and self arrogance to the point that's no different than listening to Fox News defending Trump.

It is all superficial that does nothing to address the actual struggles needed to achieve peace and safety for both Palestinians and Israelis.

There are far more legitimate ways to actually make a difference than superficial stunts and uneducated¬†ravings.

If they really want to make a difference they should work with local Israeli/Palestinian peace groups like Standing Together and Combatants for Peace and others like it that are working to address the complex issues here from the ground up rather than useless feel good stunts that have zero impact.

And there are plenty that can be done from addressing systemic issues to partnering with the organizations here that are fighting to make a difference. The very organizations and people that are going to make a difference in the future here. The very systemic issues at the heart of our fighting.

But that involves challenging the preset narratives that so many in the west have. It involves humanization of people rather than branding everyone with the same paint brush.

But so many are unwilling to learn or they succumb to populist propaganda. And that is why I know so many of them don't actually give a crap about Palestinians but only because it is the popular trend.

Cost of living is ridiculous, inflation aswell, taxes are way to high for what we get and how we live.

If you do not have a nice paying job and help from your parents you will never own a house in the center not even to mention tel aviv.

I keep plugging this podcast, Unapologetic: the Third Narrative, but it's super relevant. The hosts are two Palestinian-Israelis who are ""unapologetically"" Palestinian and anti-Hamas, want a reformed PA, want better governance from Palestinians, want a long lasting durable peace, want to be able to live with Jews. In this particular episode, they talk with two Australian Jews, one of whom is also Israeli. Among other things, they call out people who are advocating for violent Palestinian resistance while safely living in London or Melbourne or wherever. They call out BDS for silencing the voices, voices like theirs, who are actually trying to change the status quo. They call out ""peace"" activists who are promoting the preconditions for another war in 5, 10, 15 years.


The conversation can be uncomfortable because, as the title says, they're unapologetically Palestinian and they have harsh things to say about Israel, but it's worth confronting uncomfortable truths about the past in order to build a better future.


And it's incredibly worthwhile to amplify the Palestinian voices that are trying to replace Hamas and the PA with a more functional, forward thinking, peaceful form of governance.¬†","   i keep plugging this podcast, unapologetic  the third narrative, but it s super relevant. the hosts are two palestinian israelis who are  unapologetically  palestinian and anti hamas, want a reformed pa, want better governance from palestinians, want a long lasting durable peace, want to be able to live with jews. in this particular episode, they talk with two australian jews, one of whom is also israeli. among other things, they call out people who are advocating for violent palestinian resistance while safely living in london or melbourne or wherever. they call out bds for silencing the voices, voices like theirs, who are actually trying to change the status quo. they call out  peace  activists who are promoting the preconditions for another war in 5, 10, 15 years.   the conversation can be uncomfortable because, as the title says, they re unapologetically palestinian and they have harsh things to say about israel, but it s worth confronting uncomfortable truths about the past in order to build a better future.   and it s incredibly worthwhile to amplify the palestinian voices that are trying to replace hamas and the pa with a more functional, forward thinking, peaceful form of governance.

So what the future holds I don't know. however if I had to guess is that we will make peace with our neighbors such as Saudi etc down the line (whenever that is, this generation, next one or after).

Islam will have a major shift similar to what happend to Judism and Christianity where the majority will become more secular. we need to remember that Islam only started 1400 years ago compared to Judism 4000 years+ and Christianity 2000 years, also how many people in Europe are just now going athiest but Europe even 200 years ago was very religious.

I think that as time passes the more extremist approach to religion will be under control by a more secular government.

2024-08-08 19:09:42,Israel,Palestine,1en9swy,lh5lcx8,Why I No Longer Support the Two-State Solution for Israel and Palestine:...,"Here's the thing about framing all the discourse around a two-state solution:

The first thing to consider is obviously an actual situation in which we have two states, the state of Israel and a Palestinian state. For it to be any different from the situation we are currently in, the Palestinian state must have full sovereignty over its territory, otherwise we will have done nothing. Call me crazy, but with a proven history of hostility towards Israel, a desire for revenge, the insistence on returning Palestinians to the homes they held in 1948, and a whole myriad of other reasons in the same vein, it's safe to assume that the Palestinians would not be content with just their state and would seek to invade and take territory from Israel. Even if we were to ignore their own desire for the rest of Israel's territory, we cannot ignore Iran's influence on them which would surely result in more hostilities. Since in this scenario the Palestinian state is full sovereign, Israel would not be able to do any of the things we do now to prevent this incursion of foreign influence or amassing of weapons/troops in order to attack Israel. This means that Israel would have to invade the Palestinian state and defeat it in war, and if we would want to prevent further hostilities then we would have to go back to occupying them, bringing us back to square one. There is no way a sovereign Palestinian state with the climate as it is would not result in a catastrophe. If Palestinians would choose to make peace, abandon any notion of their own version of the Law of Return, and be willing to invest in their own prosperity instead of in attacking Israel, then we would have something to talk about. Palestinians would prosper, develop, and become a model for how great the Middle East could be, but until then their attitude will remain that of a primitive Middle East that we can see in countries like Egypt or Iraq.

But now to the scary part: what's the alternative? I described what I think would result from a two-state solution (i.e.: it degenerating back to a one-state solution + occupation), but then what's the alternative? Palestinians living in occupation in perpetuity? We as people are conditioned to always look for a solution first, forgetting that some problems simply don't have one. You cannot eliminate poverty or crime, you can only reduce it to a level you deem tolerable. Is the Israel/Palestine conflict one of such cases? To me it's a harrowing thought, looking an entire people in the eye and telling them ""you will live under occupation **forever**"" is depressing, but you simply can't ignore the fact that if you teach to hate your neighbor on an institutional level and refuse to take **any** accountability for past transgressions then there is no deal to talk about. There is nothing they can **say** to convince me that they are serious about running a state, they have to **do**.

In a perfect world we would have two states, each prospering in their own way, having made peace with their past and living in harmonious, jolly cooperation. But we don't live in a perfect world, we live in the Middle East.","here s the thing about framing all the discourse around a two state solution   the first thing to consider is obviously an actual situation in which we have two states, the state of israel and a palestinian state. for it to be any different from the situation we are currently in, the palestinian state must have full sovereignty over its territory, otherwise we will have done nothing. call me crazy, but with a proven history of hostility towards israel, a desire for revenge, the insistence on returning palestinians to the homes they held in 1948, and a whole myriad of other reasons in the same vein, it s safe to assume that the palestinians would not be content with just their state and would seek to invade and take territory from israel. even if we were to ignore their own desire for the rest of israel s territory, we cannot ignore iran s influence on them which would surely result in more hostilities. since in this scenario the palestinian state is full sovereign, israel would not be able to do any of the things we do now to prevent this incursion of foreign influence or amassing of weapons troops in order to attack israel. this means that israel would have to invade the palestinian state and defeat it in war, and if we would want to prevent further hostilities then we would have to go back to occupying them, bringing us back to square one. there is no way a sovereign palestinian state with the climate as it is would not result in a catastrophe. if palestinians would choose to make peace, abandon any notion of their own version of the law of return, and be willing to invest in their own prosperity instead of in attacking israel, then we would have something to talk about. palestinians would prosper, develop, and become a model for how great the middle east could be, but until then their attitude will remain that of a primitive middle east that we can see in countries like egypt or iraq.  but now to the scary part  what s the alternative?

I think a lot of the popularity of the pal cause amongst college students has to do with the fact that concepts like colonialism etc are new and shiny, and college students are eager to throw big new words around, especially if they seem ‚Äúsubversive‚Äù (see? I used another one!)

Also, at that stage in life many kids feel the need to rebel against their parents‚Äô generation and the establishment/moderate stances.

For me I think the two combined and thats how I wound up at SJP and JVP rallies.

2024-05-26 14:12:40,Israel,Palestine,1d10nqb,l5qw7m6,The Israel-Palestine conflict will never end,"You say it‚Äôs a fact, but I beg to differ. Back in the 60‚Äôs, the common conception was that a recognition of Israel by Arab states was a fool‚Äôs dream ‚Äî they keep attacking us, and outright call for Israel‚Äôs destruction. The infamous quote of Nasser ‚Äúwe will drive the Jews to the sea‚Äù was echoed throughout the Arab world.

But after the Yom Kippur war, everything changed: Egyptian leadership understood that fighting Israel over and over only to lose time and time again wasn‚Äôt going to change anything. Their losses were so massive that they understood that more wars will only weaken them, that it‚Äôs a pointless conflict. So eventually, they acquiesced and signed the peace treaty with Israel. This was a momentous event: Egypt is by far the biggest nation in the Arab world, and was the leader of the Arab League at the time. They were the leaders of the anti-Israel camp, and the first to recognize Israel‚Äôs legitimacy.

Similarly, Jordan has seen itself as the protectorate of the Palestinian people for many decades. But after the 1st Palestinian intifada (and their king being assassinated by Palestinian terrorists), they also understood that Israel isn‚Äôt going anywhere and signed a peace agreement.

The recent Abraham Accords did one better: Arab countries with no borders with Israel saw the potential in having good relations with Israel and signed a peace agreement. The UAE specifically is an amazing case: they were infiltrated by Mossad operatives who committed an assassination in their land  ‚Äî a national humiliation as they saw it ‚Äî and they still found it more beneficial to put that aside and come to terms with us, which benefited both Israel and the UAE immensely.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is much more complex and there‚Äôs a lot of bad blood between us, certainly. But it‚Äôs not unprecedented that seemingly ‚Äúmortal enemies‚Äù of Israel have come to live peacefully with it. I‚Äôm not trying to say that it will definitely happen, but there is a chance that it will.

But I also think there‚Äôs evidence that Hamas has been running a propaganda campaign in the US since the 90s which has sustained the Western opposition to the peace process in action.

https://extremism.gwu.edu/hamas-networks-america

The encampments, for instance, only served to distract Americans from a ceasefire as Hamas‚Äôs position in negotiations was weakening. Egypt and Qatar were alluding negatively to Hamas in the press. And then, the news shifts to these American college protesters, using a lot of Hamas language. The negotiations fell apart, no one paid attention to why, and now they can convince Americans to condemn the Rafah operation. 

I am concerned these networks in America are a large source of Hamas‚Äôs power in this conflict, and are potentially being amplified by Russian troll operations targeting key points of discord for American society leading up to the 2024 election. (The protests also overshadowed Trump‚Äôs first criminal trial.)

The Shaw Commission estimated the number in 1928 of Moslems at 660,000 and Christians 79,000. The number of Moslems in Palestine therefore increased from 1922 to 1928 by 70,000, and Christians by 6,000.

The Beduin, it has since made clear, numbered then at most 65,000 and not as given, 103,000. So that the Shaw Commission erred by some 40,000 in its estimate for 1928.

On a deeper look,the plan was made in 2002 by Saudi Arabia in order to distance themselves from the 9/11 attacks and to appear more moderate. There are claims that the plan is disingenuous,made knowing it would be turned down and to be used only as a diplomatic stick.

On a practical level,some countries (in the Arab League) will like to make peace or indifferent to it. But some do use Israel as an easy target for their masses to hate and direct blame on issues,domestic,regional, and global.

So, while there is a legal framework that all the Arab League members will make peace with Israel,the situation on the ground may differ.

The name Judea comes from the time when there was a Kingdom of Yehuda (Judea) and a Kingdom of Israel, but before that, there was the United Monarchy of Israel. So Israel is just a more unifying name, than a name that refers to just one tribe/kingdom. (even if most Jews today descend from either the tribe of Yehuda (To the best of our knowledge) or the tribe of Levi. (Cohen and Levi \[generally\] are both from Levi.)

Now personally, as far as names go, I like the Rudy Rochman solution: You can call it Palestine and I can call it Israel. That's for the people who have a connection to this land. For outsiders, it's probably better to call it Israel when referring to territory that is part of the state of Israel and Palestine when referring to the territory that is part of Palestine. I guess you can adjust with your company but it's probably better not to feed into ""it's all Palestine/Israel"" narratives.

Basically emotionally everyone is entitled to call it what they relate to, but politically it's better to keep a clear demarcation, unless you're advocating for a one-state solution, in which case, just call it Israel/Palestine or Palestine/Israel.

2024-08-23 08:19:32,Israel,Palestine,1ez4vs0,ljij8ub,Is this why is it called Palestine and Palestinians? ,"Short answer: The name Palestine is more ancient than the Roman province of Syria Palestinae by at the very least 6 centuries. The Arabs have used the name Filastin/Palestine for the region since the 7th century CE. There has been a *regional* identity of Arabs in the region of Palestine for many centuries, but the *national* identity of Palestinians as an Arab nationality is relatively new. The confusion about the origin of the naming of Palestinians is based in this (often unknown/misunderstood) historical context. 

Longer answer: The first extrabiblical mention of the name Palestine is from the 5th century BCE in the *Histories* by Herodotus, called *Pilistine* in Greek, where he used this name for the region of the southwestern shore of Mandatory Palestine ‚Äî roughly corresponding to the area of modern day Gaza, Ashkelon, Ashdod, and some territory inland. This is likely a translation from the ancient Hebrew word ◊§◊ú◊©◊™ *Peleshet*, mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as well, which denotes the area where the Philistines lived. The meaning of the word *Peleshet* is probably derived from the Hebrew stem ◊§-◊ú-◊© *P-L-SH*, which is semantically associated with ‚Äúinvasion/invaders‚Äù, as the Philistines were related to the Sea People: a people that invaded the Eastern Mediterranean in the 12th century BCE in a period called the Bronze Age Collapse.  The name *Peleshet* is also mentioned in ancient Egyptian (12th century BCE) and Assyrian (8th century BCE) manuscripts as a name for the same region/people, most likely as cognates of the Hebrew word. 

The name Pilistine/Palestina was used by the Greeks and Romans, respectively, long before the province was called Syria Palestinae. However, this name was used to denote a geographic region, and not in any administrative capacity; the area of Pilistine/Palestina was the region where the Philistines once lived, and so was named after them. 

The renaming of the provinces of Judaea (roughly the area of Mandatory Palestine, but without the Negev and with the eastern side of the Jordan river) to Syria Palestinae was carried out as a punishment for the Jews in the 2nd century CE, after the failed Bar Kochba revolt in 132-136. In the 4th century the province was divided into two, and renamed Palestinae Prima (First Palestine) and Palestinae Secundae (Second Palestine), and the area of the Negev and Sinai (that wasn‚Äôt a part of Syria Palestinae) was named Palestinae Tertia (Third Palestine). Since then, the common European and Christian name for this region has been, and still remains, Palestine. 

In the 7th century, after the Muslim conquest of the Levant, this region under the Islamic Caliphates was named Jund Filastin (Jund is an Islamic term for a military district, and Filastin is Arabic for Palestine). Since then, a common (although not exclusive) name for the region in the Muslim world has been, and still remains, Filastin/Palestine. After the Muslim conquest, the region has always been under either Christian or Muslim rule: sometimes it was called Syria (or some variation of it), sometimes Palestine (or some variation of it), and sometimes something else (like the Kingdom of Jerusalem). 

The name Palestine is an exonym for the region (or at least began as such): a name used by non-natives for a place or a people; we don‚Äôt know how the Philistines called their land. The endonym, i.e. the name used for an area or a people by the natives, for this area (or the area closest to it) is either *Yisrael* ‚Äî which is the name used by Jews for both the People of Israel (like in *Am Yisrael Chai*), as well as the region itself which is called *Eretz Yisrael*, literally ‚ÄúLand of Israel‚Äù ‚Äî or Canaan, *Kna‚Äôan* ‚Äî which is the name for the region used by the Canaanites/Phoenicians. Jews have never stopped referring to the region of Palestine by its Hebrew name ◊ê◊®◊• ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú *Eretz Yisrael*, often shortened to the acronym ◊ê◊¥◊ô. Palestine and *Eretz Yisrael* are literally just 2 names for the same region ‚Äî not unlike how Germany and Deutschland are 2 names for the same country. 

But, and this is a big but, since neither Canaanites nor Jews have been the majority population in the region for many centuries, and with the region being ruled by many different peoples along the centuries, eventually in the last 1,000+ years the majority of the population in the area have been Arabs, which have become native to the region for all intents and purposes (just to put thing in perspective: Slavs have migrated to the Balkans in roughly the same time the Arabs conquered the Levant). Although the Arabs in the region didn‚Äôt see themselves as having a distinct *national* identity until relatively recently (last ~100 years), they did have a distinct *regional* identity for a long time and they did often call this area Filastin/Palestine. Thus, the name Palestine has come to be recognized with the Arabs that live in the region of Palestine. 

There have been Arabs, as well as non-Arabs, that have called themselves Palestinians (or ‚Äúof Palestine‚Äù) before the last 100 years ‚Äî but this naming was used to denote *regional origin*, rather than *national affiliation*; there have been Palestinian Arabs ‚Äî as in Arabs of Palestine‚Äî for a long time, but the Palestinians as a *nationality* are relatively new. The reason the Palestinians call themselves Palestinians is because Arabs living in this region, which is their homeland (or has been until 1948 for many of them), have called this region Palestine or the Arabic equivalent for a very long time. In other words, there have been Palestinian Arabs for many centuries, but the national identity of Palestinians ‚Äî which is an Arab national identity‚Äî dates back to the late 19th century at the earliest. The confusion stems from the fact that there hasn‚Äôt been a neat or precise point in time when the Palestinian Arabs have ‚Äútransformed‚Äù from ‚ÄúArabs of Palestine‚Äù to ‚Äúthe Arab nationality of Palestinians‚Äù, because it doesn‚Äôt work like that in real life.","short answer  the name palestine is more ancient than the roman province of syria palestinae by at the very least 6 centuries. the

years the majority of the population in the area have been arabs, which have become native to the region for all intents and purposes  just to put thing in perspective  slavs have migrated to the balkans in roughly the same time the arabs conquered the levant . although the arabs in the region didn t see themselves as having a distinct  national  identity until relatively recently  last  100 years , they did have a distinct  regional  identity for a long time and they did often call this area filastin palestine. thus, the name palestine has come to be recognized with the arabs that live in the region of palestine.   there have been arabs, as well as non arabs, that have called themselves palestinians  or  of palestine   before the last 100 years   but this naming was used to denote  regional origin , rather than  national affiliation   there have been palestinian arabs   as in arabs of palestine  for a long time, but the palestinians as a  nationality  are relatively new. the reason the palestinians call themselves palestinians is because arabs living in this region, which is their homeland  or has been until 1948 for many of them , have called this region palestine or the arabic equivalent for a very long time. in other words, there have been palestinian arabs for many centuries, but the national identity of palestinians   which is an arab national identity  dates back to the late 19th century at the earliest. the confusion stems from the fact that there hasn t been a neat or precise point in time when the palestinian arabs have  transformed  from  arabs of palestine  to  the arab nationality of palestinians , because it doesn t work like that in real life.","short answer name palestine ancient roman province syria palestinae least 6 centuries. arabs

I‚Äôve heard two different possible etymologies of the name, one is that Palestina comes from Philistia, and is meant as an insult to the Jews. 

The other is that Palestina comes from Greek, and I believe Herodotus referred to the region as a district of Syria named Palestin√™ in the 5th century bce. This name may also be derived from the Phillistines, who were also known as the Peleset.

And here people do call the west bank Judea and Samaria. But thats considered by many especially outside of Israel to be politically and ideologically encumbered. 

Interestingly, nobody seems to have an issue calling the Judean desert in the west bank by that name lol.","the romans renamed the provice syria palestinia some time near the bar kochba revolt.  i ve heard two different possible etymologies of the name, one is that palestina comes from philistia, and is meant as an insult to the jews.   the other is that palestina comes from greek, and i believe herodotus referred to the region as a district of syria named palestin  in the 5th century bce. this name may also be derived from the phillistines, who were also known as the peleset.  and here people do call the west bank judea and samaria. but thats considered by many especially outside of israel to be politically and ideologically encumbered.   interestingly, nobody seems to have an issue calling the judean desert in the west bank by that name lol.","romans renamed provice syria palestinia time near bar kochba revolt. heard two different possible etymologies name, one palestina comes philistia, meant insult jews. palestina comes greek, believe herodotus referred region district syria named palestin 5th century bce. name may also derived phillistines, also known peleset. people call west bank judea samaria. thats considered many especially outside israel politically ideologically encumbered. interestingly, nobody seems issue calling judean desert west bank name lol.",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1ez4vs0/is_this_why_is_it_called_palestine_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1ez4vs0/is_this_why_is_it_called_palestine_and/ljieswb,39.35880398671097,0.7269,2.0794415416798357,3.6978095614167636,1

After the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem, the Babylonians put a loyal local government centred around the city, the province was named Judia thr province of the Jews
After the Parsian conquest, the Greek conquest and the Roman conquest a series of bloody revolts ended by the Romans reorganising the area and renaming the new province Palestine .
During the next 1300 years, the area was named and renamed many times. The Christian name was actually often ""The Holy Land"" 
The Ottoman empire (who ruled the area for the longest recorded time) actually split the province as they often did to avoid civil fermentation. They also often moved populations around. They used Palestine as the name that was used afterwards by the British.
The land called Israel is both the name of the nation and a theoretical border of the current (beloved) sovereign state, it has many variations from the Complete Land of Israel, the Two Sides of The River and to the much smaller UN separation plan (1945), the 1948 cease fire line and the 1967 borders.

The name Israel arose from the incident in which Jacob wrestled with an angel (Genesis 32:25‚Äì27). Jacob received the name Israel (*Yisra‚Äôel* in Hebrew) because he ‚Äúwrestled (*sarita‚Äô*) with the Lord (*El*).‚Äù In the Septuagint, the Greek verb *epalaien* (he wrestled) is used to describe Jacob‚Äôs struggle with the stranger.[^(14)](https://library.biblicalarchaeology.org/endnote/endnote-14-when-palestine-meant-israel/) The etymological similarity between *epalaien* and *Palaistin√™* raises the possibility that *Palaistin√™* may somehow be linked to the name Israel through this Biblical episode.  


  
Interesting theory!  
Whatever the etymology is, a few things are certain:

  
1) The name Palestine was invented by White European Colonizers (Greeks and then Romans), nobody in Palestine called their land Palestine back then. When Arabs colonized the land they picked up the name from the Byzantines. It's as indigenous as ""New York"" and ""Greenland"".   
  
2) The Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Ottomans, all viewed Palestine as a rural region of Greater Syria, not a distinct country as the local Jews viewed it.","    the name israel arose from the incident in which jacob wrestled with an angel  genesis 32 25 27 . jacob received the name israel   yisra el  in hebrew  because he  wrestled   sarita    with the lord   el  .  in the septuagint, the greek verb  epalaien   he wrestled  is used to describe jacob s struggle with the stranger.   14    the etymological similarity between  epalaien  and  palaistin   raises the possibility that  palaistin   may somehow be linked to the name israel through this biblical episode.        interesting theory!   whatever the etymology is, a few things are certain      1  the name palestine was invented by white european colonizers  greeks and then romans , nobody in palestine called their land palestine back then. when arabs colonized the land they picked up the name from the byzantines. it s as indigenous as  new york  and  greenland .       2  the greeks, romans, arabs, ottomans, all viewed palestine as a rural region of greater syria, not a distinct country as the local jews viewed it.","name israel arose incident jacob wrestled angel genesis 32 25 27 . jacob received name israel yisra el hebrew wrestled sarita lord el . septuagint, greek verb epalaien wrestled used describe jacob struggle stranger. 14 etymological similarity epalaien palaistin raises possibility palaistin may somehow linked name israel biblical episode. interesting theory! whatever etymology is, things certain 1 name palestine invented white european colonizers greeks romans , nobody palestine called land palestine back then. arabs colonized land picked name byzantines. indigenous new york greenland . 2 greeks, romans, arabs, ottomans, viewed palestine rural region greater syria, distinct country local jews viewed it.",25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1fnizpy/palestine_as_a_name_for_israel_derives_from_an/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1fnizpy/palestine_as_a_name_for_israel_derives_from_an/loj63bx,43.97584541062802,0.6476,3.258096538021482,3.806125577005744,1

>In a private conversation with media and business executives, CIA director Bill Burns, who‚Äôs been involved in the ceasefire/hostage deal negotiations, assessed that Hamas‚Äôs leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, is facing growing pressure from his own military commanders to end the war and accept the proposed deal. Furthermore, Sinwar is now especially aware of the growing public pressure and anger within Gaza towards Hamas due to the ‚Äúenormity of the suffering‚Äù that civilians are experiencing, causing the group‚Äôs chief, who is ‚Äúnot concerned with his own mortality,‚Äù to feel the pressure that may result in an opening in negotiations. Once again, a suicidal psychopath has been dragging the Palestinians down because he wants to be a martyr and doesn‚Äôt care if all of Gaza is destroyed with him.

>So, here‚Äôs something that I‚Äôve been saying repeatedly throughout the war and was attacked, mocked, or ignored for it: why didn‚Äôt the pro-Palestine community and protesters demand that Hamas accept a ceasefire deal? Why not call for the hostages to be released along with the calls for a ceasefire? Why not direct some of the passionate sentiments towards the Islamist group to make it feel some public pressure to end the war that it started? People kept saying, ‚ÄúOh, we don‚Äôt have influence over Hamas, but we can influence our government, which supports Israel.‚Äù Hogwash! Hamas paid close attention to the worldwide demonstrations and international pressure that it was solely counting on to stop the war. Their whole strategy was that the global outcry against the horrendous suffering and mass killings in Gaza would force Israel to end the war on Hamas‚Äôs terms.  
  
>Worse, not only did Hamas not face any calls to moderate its stance, but it actually received massive support among the diaspora communities and ‚Äúallies‚Äù who embraced extreme anti-Israel positions, supported armed resistance, celebrated October 7, promoted maximalist views, and refused to hold Hamas accountable for its egregious and evil recklessness that got Gaza destroyed and tens of thousands needlessly killed. After nine months of failed international pressure to end the war, Hamas is slowly acknowledging that its master plan to stop the war has failed. And damned be the people of Gaza, who are cannon fodder for nefarious Jihadi ideologies and Iranian aspirations for regional dominance.  
  
>If you didn‚Äôt see this during the war; if you mindlessly played along and let misguided and ill-informed activists guide your speech and actions; if you failed to place any blame or responsibility on Hamas for starting this war and refusing to bring it to a swift end, this nine-month-long mess is partially on you ‚Äì you are morally, ethically, karmically, politically, spiritually and common-sensically (Yes, I made up that word) responsible for where we are today in Gaza. Sit with that if you really care and want to try something different ‚Äì it‚Äôs not too late to adjust course and stop promoting Hamas and its armed resistance narrative that kills/destroys Palestinians and worsens the occupation of their lands.

This occurred during both the Ottoman and the British administrations, beginning in the mid to late 1800's. They tried to buy the areas in the hills (the West Bank today), but nobody would sell to them. So they had to buy the coastal swamps and inland deserts. The Jews were able to turn the environment into very productive land. When the war ended and the UN approved the partition plan mostly along the major lines of ownership, Israel accepted and declared independence. The Arab League (representing Palestine) rejected it and declared war, and lost. That was the beginning of the Nakba, which is common to hear brought up. Many Arabs left their homes because they were told to, and they were not allowed to come back. Similar things happened to Jews who lived in Arabs areas, but on a smaller scale because they didn't lose.

2024-06-09 05:11:11,Israel,Palestine,1dbky5x,l7ry7px,ELI5: Did Israel buy Palestine?,"First, a quick history of the region.

Jews were expelled from Judea by the Romans around the 2nd century CE and the land was renamed Syria-Palaestina after the Philistines, Biblical enemies of the Jews, to mock them. During the Byzantine period, the region was split into 3 provinces named Palaestina Prima, Palaestina Secunda, and Palaestina Tertia. 
After the Muslim conquest, the region became a military district named Jund Filastin, which encompassed most of Prima and Tertia and established a new city named Ramla as its capital. Later it became the Kingdom of Jerusalem (Latin Kingdom) and some time after that it was held by the Mamluk Sultanate. The Ottoman Empire was the last entity that held that region before the British Mandate of Palestine and later the establishment of the State of Israel.

And now for some details about how the State of Israel was established.

After World War II all the empires collapsed and national identity became the main goal, so the Jews decided to gather on land that was [legitimately] bought and owned by other Jews and later tried to establish a homeland with the help of the British Empire. It was met with a lot of aggression from the Arab-Muslims, because they didn't want a state that was under Jewish rule.

2024-06-09 07:59:03,Israel,Palestine,1dbky5x,l7sd8o0,ELI5: Did Israel buy Palestine?,"For context, the name Palestine comes from the Romans - who, after an unsuccessful Jewish revolt against Roman occupation of Judea in the 2nd century, renamed the land Syria-Palestina. It's important to keep in mind that the land renamed Palestine was never an independent state's territory - the land renamed Palestine was under occupation of this or that empire, taken by conquest. 

Now, did the first Zionists, Jews who raised funds and came to this land with the goal of reestablishing an independent Jewish state for the purpose of giving the Jewish people worldwide a safe haven, buy lands here peacefully? It's a bit complicated. Arab land owners often sold overpriced bad lands (such as malaria-filled swamps) to Zionists - these deals didn't come to blows, so technically they were peaceful, however this obviously isn't a fair deal. The Zionists took it because it was the best they could get but it was pretty scammy. 

The thing is, many Arabs at the time thought the Jews would soon give up on living in swamps and leave - however the Zionists came up with many solutions to the poor land conditions and dried up the swamps, actually built functioning towns, planting fields of crops, etc. This obviously meant the Jews were here to stay, so many Arabs had taken to attacking these new towns, burning fields and the like - so, was the aftermath of the monetary exchange over the lands peaceful? No.

Pro-Palestinians often point to what I've taken to call ""the four map myth"" - the first they show is a map of 19th century Palestine and say the entire land is Palestinian; this is false - the entire land is a province of the Ottoman Empire, with some lands being privately owned. The second is the same map with dots of blue that show Jewish-owned lands; these are the aforementioned lands, legally bought by Jews from the Arab landowners, the rest of the map is - again - Ottoman territory and not an independent Palestinian state. The third map they show is the Partition Plan presented in the UN on 29 November 1947, which about a 60-40 divide of the land into Arab and Jewish states; this map is purely theoretical, as it never came to be in reality - on 30 November the Arab citizens of the British Mandate of Palestine attacked the Jewish citizens, thus starting a civil war that came to be known as the Israel Independence War. The presentation of shift in territories conveniently skips the years 1948-2004, I suspect this is because in 1948-1967 parts of ""Palestine"" were conquered by Egypt, Jordan and Syria - this undermines the myth of Arab solidarity, or that the Arabs fought to help Palestinians as they've clearly taken the land for themselves (up until the 1980s Jordan argued that the West Bank is ""stolen"" Jordanian territory). Looking again at the 4-map myth, the next map we see is a 2005 map showing A Territories and Gaza Strip as Palestinian lands with the rest of the map being painted blue to signify Jewish ownership; this is the closest to truth the Four Maps display - Gaza Strip is in a complicated legal position but we can call it an autonomy, and the A Territories in the West Bank are in complete control of the Palestinian Authority, making them the first actually-Palestinian sorta-independent Palestinian lands in history. (B Territories in the West Bank are under shared PA-Israeli rule, Israel being responsible solely for security) 

This is obviously just the tip of the iceberg, no single comment on Reddit can give you the full picture. For a look at Israel-Palestine history leaning into the Israeli perspective I highly recommend Noa Tishbi's book, it's a good start for someone who wants to look deeper into this over-century-long conflict","for context, the name palestine comes from the romans   who, after an unsuccessful jewish revolt against roman occupation of judea in the 2nd century, renamed the land syria palestina. it s important to keep in mind that the land renamed palestine was never an independent state s territory   the land renamed palestine was under occupation of this or that empire, taken by conquest.   now, did the first zionists, jews who raised funds and came to this land with the goal of reestablishing an independent jewish state for the purpose of giving the jewish people worldwide a safe haven, buy lands here peacefully?

Khan KC: Applications for arrest warrants in the situation in the State of Palestine | International Criminal Court ,"I found reading the ICC prosecutor‚Äôs statement about the warrants very helpful, because the reporting about them in the media is very unclear, imprecise, and of course, horribly biased against Israel.

After reading the statement, my sense is that the ICC is pretty unlikely to grant the prosecutor‚Äôs application for warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant.  Legally the allegations are thin and there are serious jurisdictional problems because Israel is not a member of the ICC or a signatory to the Rome Statute. The prosecutor asserts without explanation that the Rome Statute applies because the alleged illegal conduct occured in the territory of a signatory - Palestine - but this is by no means obvious.

There are serious problems with the prosecutor‚Äôs argument, since: (a) it requires a finding that Gaza remains a part of ‚ÄúPalestine‚Äù despite not being governed by the PA; (b) even if it is ‚ÄúPalestine,‚Äù that it has not repudiated the Rome Statute by the governance of Hamas, which rejects the treaty; and (c) that government policy determinations of political leaders in Israel, who have not subjected themselves to the Rome Statute‚Äôs terms, constitute ‚Äúconduct‚Äù in violation of the Rome Statute if effectuated in the territory of a signatory.

I think the ICC will be very hesitant to agree with the prosecutor on these controversial and unprecedented points, as doing so would immediately bring it into major conflict with not only the US, but every major power. International law operates on the basis of consent, via treaties and long held and ascribed customs. Application of the Rome Statute to two non-consenting parties (Hamas and Israel) is contrary to the basic foundations of international law that give it legitimacy.

The statement shows that the prosecutor is clearly aware of the legal and jurisdictional headwinds the application will face with the Judges, but he clearly felt obliged to submit the application anyways to make a statement.

~~~~<<<<<<~~~~~~~<<<<<<<<~~~~~~
How would Palestinians & ‚Äúpalestine should exist supporters‚Äù like to see the conflict with Israel End: From an ‚ÄúAnti-Palestine should exist‚Äù Activist who Genuinely Wants to Better Understand you

I want to be 100% clear: I am not interested in debating anyone, trying to change minds, or even discussing my own views, I am posting here with a desire to learn more about people who view themselves as Palestinian/‚ÄúPalestine should exist supporters‚Äù. You can obviously see from my post history that I am quite anti Palestine/‚Äúanti Palestine should exist‚Äù, but genuinely, I am posting here because I am interested in learning about the pro Palestine-‚ÄúPalestine should exist‚Äù perspectives. 

I am Jewish so I have never been to Gaza. I also have never been to the West Bank. I have though been to israel twice, and have known several Palestinians personally. 
Those Palestinians I met in passing would speak to me and about people who came from my background (Jews) with the utmost condescension. 

Those Palestinians I know closely, even those I considered to be genuinely good, kind people, would eventually let those same views slip out as they became more comfortable with me, and also let their views slip out through unequal treatment of the people around them. (One such person was a teacher and tutor who would treat her Jewish and Israeli students more harshly and critically than students of other backgrounds. She actively discouraged me from pursuing further education, especially in the subject she taught. I have improved tremendously in it since then, but I have to be frank and say her words of discouragement did affect the path I took) I get a lot of news from the region by reading Al Jazeera and other Qatar funded news sites, who I am sorry to tell you make FOX News look like objective bastions of real journalism.

Obviously I understand that anecdotal experiences don‚Äôt define a community, and I want to do more work to understand you guys before being comfortable in my judgement. After the current conflict is over in addition to humanitarian work in israel, mostly the destroyed and incinerated kibbutzim near the Gaza border and the destroyed towns, infrastructure, agricultural fields, etc in the north due to Hezbollah, I would like to spend some in Gaza and the West Bank to try and meet more people there. 

This most likely won‚Äôt be allowed/legal for me to go and it wouldn‚Äôt be safe for me. I‚Äôve never visited, not even when I was a kid, or a teen, and probably not now as an adult. 

I have a genuine interest in understanding what the average Palestinian wants a post conflict Israel and Palestine to look like. 

To be frank, with most interactions with American Palestinians and Palestine supporters, the conclusion they want is, and I am sorry if this upsets you to hear, genocide or ethnic cleansing. 

The most common solution I hear is a one state solution with Palestinians from the river to the sea with the Jews exiled. 

Extremists will suggest this happens ‚Äúonce israel is destroyed‚Äù and once ‚ÄúThe Day of Judgement finally comes about when the Moslems fight the Jews (killing the Jews), and when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Moslems, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him.‚Äù

Is this viewpoint pretty reflective of Palestinian society? Or is it just palestinian Americans and pro Palestine supporters sitting between two oceans not understanding how the world works.

2024-05-30 02:11:00,Israel,Palestine,1d3sbgp,l69ngti,How would Israelis like to see the conflict with Palestine End: From an Anti Zionist Activist who Genuinely Wants to Better Understand you,"By conflict we mean the war or the conflict in general?

**For the war**, Hamas replaced with a peaceful leadership that remove the radical ideas from the population and Israeli security control to prevent such massacre of the 7th Of October from returning. That would also allow Israel and Egypt to remove the blockade as it was put specifically to limit Hamas.

**As for the conflict,** one thing you'd see most Israelis and pro-Israeli talk about is security. Majority of Israelis and their supporters view Palestinians as a threat that wants to destroy them and kill them considering every peace offer Israel gave them resulted in Palestinian terror attack and in general the Palestinians never try any peaceful negotiation, only terror... Not to mention the polls among them prove the same thing (Big majority wants a Palestinian state from the river to the sea with no Jews, polls conducted on Palestinians from both territories).

So the specific final solution to the conflict is not what really matters... Majority of Israelis don't think about land specifically - they think about what can reduce the terror coming from the Palestinians. Majority of Israelis see the peaceful negotiations lead nowhere so they moved to a more defensive approach where Palestinians are allowed to determine their own rules but have many limitations preventing them from terrorizing Israel.

You need to remember Israel is considered a western country for a good reason - the people there follow the values of peace and quite, only wanting to live their lives (proven by all the peace deals Israel does with all of its neighboring Arab countries). However when Palestinians keep attacking them, no wonder Israeli's right-wing becomes stronger and stronger... They lost all trust with their behavior and they pay for it by the fact Israel trust them with noting. Even Israeli-Arabs grow further and further from other Palestinians as they see the Palestinians terror...

So overall, if you want to talk about a solution for the Palestinians, it doesn't matter if you talk about one state for both, 2 states, one state for only one group, etc... At the end of the day people don't think about peace as a possibility because they see the Palestinians as blood thirsty monsters who only try to destroy them and prove it to them each time they perform an act of terror supported by their leadership.","by conflict we mean the war or the conflict in general?    for the war  , hamas replaced with a peaceful leadership that remove the radical ideas from the population and israeli security control to prevent such massacre of the 7th of october from returning. that would also allow israel and egypt to remove the blockade as it was put specifically to limit hamas.    as for the conflict,   one thing you d see most israelis and pro israeli talk about is security. majority of israelis and their supporters view palestinians as a threat that wants to destroy them and kill them considering every peace offer israel gave them resulted in palestinian terror attack and in general the palestinians never try any peaceful negotiation, only terror... not to mention the polls among them prove the same thing  big majority wants a palestinian state from the river to the sea with no jews, polls conducted on palestinians from both territories .  so the specific final solution to the conflict is not what really matters... majority of israelis don t think about land specifically   they think about what can reduce the terror coming from the palestinians. majority of israelis see the peaceful negotiations lead nowhere so they moved to a more defensive approach where palestinians are allowed to determine their own rules but have many limitations preventing them from terrorizing israel.  you need to remember israel is considered a western country for a good reason   the people there follow the values of peace and quite, only wanting to live their lives  proven by all the peace deals israel does with all of its neighboring arab countries . however when palestinians keep attacking them, no wonder israeli s right wing becomes stronger and stronger... they lost all trust with their behavior and they pay for it by the fact israel trust them with noting. even israeli arabs grow further and further from other palestinians as they see the palestinians terror...  so overall, if you want to talk about a solution for the palestinians, it doesn t matter if you talk about one state for both, 2 states, one state for only one group, etc... at the end of the day people don t think about peace as a possibility because they see the palestinians as blood thirsty monsters who only try to destroy them and prove it to them each time they perform an act of terror supported by their leadership.","conflict mean war conflict general? war , hamas replaced peaceful leadership remove radical ideas population israeli security control prevent massacre 7th october returning. would also allow israel egypt remove blockade put specifically limit hamas. conflict, one thing see israelis pro israeli talk security. majority israelis supporters view palestinians threat wants destroy kill considering every peace offer israel gave resulted palestinian terror attack general palestinians never try peaceful negotiation, terror... mention polls among prove thing big majority wants palestinian state river sea jews, polls conducted palestinians territories . specific final solution conflict really matters... majority israelis think land specifically think reduce terror coming palestinians. majority israelis see peaceful negotiations lead nowhere moved defensive approach palestinians allowed determine rules many limitations preventing terrorizing israel. need remember israel considered western country good reason people follow values peace quite, wanting live lives proven peace deals israel neighboring arab countries . however palestinians keep attacking them, wonder israeli right wing becomes stronger stronger... lost trust behavior pay fact israel trust noting. even israeli arabs grow palestinians see palestinians terror... overall, want talk solution palestinians, matter talk one state both, 2 states, one state one group, etc... end day people think peace possibility see palestinians blood thirsty monsters try destroy prove time perform act terror supported leadership.",11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1d3sbgp/how_would_israelis_like_to_see_the_conflict_with/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1d3sbgp/how_would_israelis_like_to_see_the_conflict_with/l69ngti,38.94878411910671,0.5002,2.4849066497880004,3.687598236682963,1

In 1968, a year after Israel gained control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip following the Six Day War, they amended their charter to claim both the West Bank and Gaza as Palestinian lands.

The claim that Palestinians are also indigenous vaguely checks out due to both Arabic and Islam being appropriated and proselytized through conquests of the 7th Century CE. Presumed Palestinians who would be indigenous to the land would have likely been forcibly converted, which, as we know, is a common tactic to eradicate indigenous people within the Arab empire and beyond. 

Because it‚Äôs scientifically impossible to determine farther back than 6-8 generations at this time, it‚Äôs truly impossible to know who was forcibly converted, who conquered and stayed and who came some time after. This is a great example of how conquerers have left blind spots in our history from the standpoint of a dwindling community of living indigenous people. 

Essentially, at least until science could potentially figure out a way of going back 4,000 years through genetics, Palestinians sort of signed away their claim to the land when they reinvented their identities to meet that of the Muslims from Mecca. Like entering a new friend group and wanting to go back to the old one‚Äôs lunch table with the new friend group and the old friend group go find a new table when the new friend group has pushed a bunch of tables together (55 to be exact. Enough with the analogies? 

When Palestinians can find their property deeds from over 4,000 years ago, they can claim their right of return as Jewish converts but occupation would require denouncing Jews of being indigenous which would fail to prove their own indigenous credibility. (Because you cannot occupy your own land) 

They cannot have a Palestine without proof they don‚Äôt have and they cannot have it without Israel. It might not be worth their time to carry on but when you‚Äôve been doing so for over 100 years, it might not be so easy to let it go.

I guess he's technically the best option for the Palestinians because unlike Hamas who actively participate in terror forcing Israel to put ton of supervision on them and attack them, he only supports terrorism so Israel can't technically do anything bad to his controlled areas.

But at the same time it also depends on what you mean by ""good for them"". According to the Palestinians: good = ""fight to destroy Israel no matter what it takes"" while for us (the western world) good = ""as little terror as can be""

>2. Is he a terrorist? Has he supported Hamas and then denounced Hamas before?.

Worse, he's a terrorist supporter. Which means he himself does not perform terror acts but he enables and support it.

It's worse because Israel can't do anything about it while against terrorists Israel can always beat them at war...

As for his relations with Hamas, it's a complicated relationship but I guess it's not too different than any rivalry between 2 opposing parties in a country... Both want the best for their country but hate each other.

>3.  Is he a Zionist?, whats his stance on Zionism? Is he pro Hamas?, Pro Palestine? Or neither?.

Not only he's not a Zionist, he literally blamed the Jews for WW2 and the holocaust.

He's as far as can be from a Zionist.

As for the ""pro-Hamas"" part, is Biden a pro-republican? is Trump a pro-Democrats? Same answer applies here.

As for ""pro-Palestine"", I mean - he's a Palestinians and he leads the PLO/PA which the world recognize as the official representative of Palestinians.

So even if Hamas is the one Palestinians support the most and the leader of Gaza - legally speaking Abbas is indeed the leader of the Palestinians. So Obviously he will be ""Pro-Palestine"" as a Palestinian and their official leader...

>4. Is Fatah a good organization? I dont know too much about Fatah. What is the good that Fatah has done? The US and Israel sees them as Allies.

In the past they were terrorists but after the Oslo accords they moved from doing terror to supporting terror.

What does it mean? They pay terrorists who do terror acts, teach their schools about the need to destroy Israel & the Jews, and refuse to actually do anything about that...

Fun fact, he payed for the terrorists who did the 7th of October massacre after the act despite them being from Gaza.

Israel doesn't see them as an ally...

As for what good has he done, he didn't attack Israel - does that count? There's also a security agreement with him so that's something I guess...

>5. Mahmoud Abbas doesnt seem like he is doing anything to help Palestine, what is his plans? Does he want to destroy Hamas? What is his plan for Palestine?

Tbh that's a really good question. On one hand he publicly calls for a 2-state solution and encourages it.

But on the other hand he refuses to do anything realistic to stop terrorism.

I think he wants to eat the cake and eat it whole.

He doesn't want to get into a war with Israel because he knows they will lose but he still wants free territory. So I think he's plan is mostly signing deals with Israel so he can get free territory and even a state but without any down sides.

It's not that he wants peace, he just doesn't think he will be able to get anything with violence (he's right), so he tries to use diplomacy as weapons.

As for Hamas, obviously he doesn't like them considering they are much more popular than him and might steal the leadership from him or his party in the future.","   i guess he s technically the best option for the palestinians because unlike hamas who actively participate in terror forcing israel to put ton of supervision on them and attack them, he only supports terrorism so israel can t technically do anything bad to his controlled areas.  but at the same time it also depends on what you mean by  good for them . according to the palestinians  good    fight to destroy israel no matter what it takes  while for us  the western world  good    as little terror as can be    2. is he a terrorist?

I have a few questions for y'all :D","I think you came here in good faith, so I'm going to answer in good faith.

>Anyone with more than two braincells DO NOT believe that israel doesn't have the right to exist.¬†*We are only preaching non-violence*.¬†

You think that's what you're preaching but you're actually not.  This is precisely what has Jews around the world so angry and scared right now.

Let me give you some background.

In 1979, Israel gave the entire Sinai peninsula back to Egypt in exchange for a peace deal.  They gave land, and in return they got an end to the 30-year ongoing hostilities between them and Egypt.  Nice.

In 1994, Israel signed a peace deal with Jordan, and in return there has been a mostly stable border and diplomatic relations, and peace between the two countries.  Nice.

Every single time that Israel has made a peace deal, or attempted to make a peace deal with the Palestinians, the result has been more violence against Israelis.  Every.  Single.  Time.

The best example of this is when Israel offered the Palestinians a state including \~95% of the West Bank and the result was a huge wave of suicide bombings - \*against civilians\* in Israel.  It's fair to ask why the Palestinians and their leadership would do this?

The answer - and the piece of information that most people such as yourselves are missing - is that \*the Palestinians only want a state if it means they can dismantle Israel and take it all for themselves.\*

Are there moderate Palestinians who want a two-state solution and just to live in peace?  Sure.  Just like there are lots of Israelis who want the same.  \*But these are not the people running things, launching rockets, attacking Israelis\*.

When you chant ""from the river to the sea, Palestine must be free"" - that river and that sea are the borders \*of Israel\*.  What that statement means is ""we get Israel"".  And lest you think that would mean some kind of one-state confederation (which no one on either side currently wants), the Arabic version of that chant is ""from the water to the water, Palestine is Arab"".

Further, if you're American or European, you should consider that imposing some half-educated version of what you think either side actually wants or would do or should do \*is imperialist\*.

So when you say you ""only want peace"" anyone with an actual knowledge of this region has a fair question: ""peace for whom?""

Everyone in the region, you might say, but especially for the oppressed Palestinians.

""Okay, how will that happen?  What would that look like?""

and that's when the crickets come in - if you're lucky.  If you're not, you get ""you are a racist!  you support genocide!""

But the \*truth\* is that \*most people\* want peace in the region.  Most everyone hates war.  No one likes to see little kids suffering.

But simply wanting peace does not make you a fucking military or political genius or some kind of revolutionary warrior.  It just makes you a decent human being.  That's what we see when we see people like you at these protests: people who might as well be holding up signs that say, ""I want to be a good person but I don't have any idea what's happening!  I believe everything I see on social media!""

I mean, kudos for you for actually visiting this sub and learning what the other side believes.

Happy to engage with you in more dialogue.

Btw, you know who doesn't actually want peace?  Who has never wanted peace and who is really openly very fucking honest about never wanting peace?

Hamas.

edit: you know what absolutely no one at these protests is waving around?  Signs that say, ""I SUPPORT MODERATE PALESTINIAN VOICES WHO LEGITIMATELY WANT PEACE AND COEXISTENCE"".  If you're not saying that, you're supporting the most violent opponents of peace in the region.  Remember that people at these protests think there's an actual genocide going on.  Remember that people at these protests think Hamas are freedom-loving revolutionaries who would lay down their weapons if they ever got political independence.  But what actually happened is that when they got a taste of independence in 2005 they used immediately to \*build a multi billion dollar terrorist state\* and attack Israel over and over and over again.  If you're really for peace as your primary goal, you should just shut up and ignore this conflict altogether because neither side actually wants peace right now.  Check back in 20 years.","i think you came here in good faith, so i m going to answer in good faith.   anyone with more than two braincells do not believe that israel doesn t have the right to exist.  we are only preaching non violence .   you think that s what you re preaching but you re actually not.  this is precisely what has jews around the world so angry and scared right now.  let me give you some background.  in 1979, israel gave the entire sinai peninsula back to egypt in exchange for a peace deal.  they gave land, and in return they got an end to the 30 year ongoing hostilities between them and egypt.  nice.  in 1994, israel signed a peace deal with jordan, and in return there has been a mostly stable border and diplomatic relations, and peace between the two countries.  nice.  every single time that israel has made a peace deal, or attempted to make a peace deal with the palestinians, the result has been more violence against israelis.  every.  single.  time.  the best example of this is when israel offered the palestinians a state including   95  of the west bank and the result was a huge wave of suicide bombings     against civilians   in israel.  it s fair to ask why the palestinians and their leadership would do this?

>Things our ancestors did or didn't do, who said what to who, who thought what, who started, who ended, none of it matters.

This is the first issue, they are still living in the past and it is supported by actions as well, take for example the refugee problem in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan ( to some extent) ect.,the avoidance of creating a palestinian state with what they had ect. , their whole strategy is to view all events after 1948 as continuing events. the whole strategy is literally to keep the Nakba relevant when it is indeed dead a long time ago.

There has been billions of dollars invested in this strategy, the brainwashing is so severe, and that's why until this day they still believe Israel could go away one day.
. 

>So, how do we, given the current situation and that no-one is going anywhere, how do we get to peace?

The Palestinian side doesn't want peace it wants a ceasfire, it is very idiotic talking about solution when you are the only one who is sitting in the table.

Like i always say, if the Israeli side woke up Norwegian and the palestinian side stayed the same, nothing much will change. If the Palestinian side woke up Norwegian and the israeli side stayed the same, the whole conflict will be solved!

So now,what is the problem with the Palestinian side? Well, the problem with the palestinian side is not (mostly) exclusive to the palestinian people, there is an Arab problem and most importantly an Islam problem, this should be aknowledged.

The Palestinians and Arabs have been and are still being Brainwashed for a long time, their mentality is broken and it is not compatible with the idea of peace alongside with otger values, so the solution is changing the mentality so they could be capable of doing so.

There is no palestinian cause, it doesn't exist, it died a long time ago, Events that should be important are not important to them, their problems are not your problems and their solutions are not your solutions. I am sadly saying this as a palestinian from diaspora who still has family in the west bank. There is too much to say that i cannot even know from where to start.

But i want to say one last thing, Destroying Hamas will help, let me explain :

Hamas is maybe the only ""thing"" that all arabs really have a holy image of, They are like : those are Hamas! They cannot even theoritically lose! They are soldiers of Allah! They are incabaple of being defeated, And that portray is exclusive for Hamas, no other Force in the middle east has that. So if Hamas gets beaten, It will be a hell of a Schock, Everyone will start questioning alot of things, they might finally understand that they have been betrayed. It will serve as a big reality check, so when Hamas gets destroyed, palestinians will know that nothing is going to be gained by violence, and anything stronger than Hamas will never come, they will lose hope like germany when dresden was flattened, or at least i hope.

Look at the PFLP now, they are irrelevant, irrelevant for Israel and Irrelevant for the palestinians, they even make fun of them that all they do is dancing on Earth Day and singing, they pretty much don't have any value, and these same people were once THE palestinian revolutionary most powerful force, they hijacked planes, assassinated prime ministers and ministers and did operations in Munich and all over the world.

But know they don't have any value, they were finished and when they were finished the idea of Leftism, Comunism and Marxism has died with them, then a new ideology came into existence and occupied the heads of the arab and palestinian people and that is Islamizim.

Also you gotta now that palestine is in the receiving end of ideologies, it really just get filled with what ever ideology is common in a particular time, what helped the PFLP was that the Idea of Pan Arabism and Marxism, Communism was still the dominating ideology, but with the fall of that ideology in the west represented by the Fall of the Soviets and then the fall of their followers aka the Pan arabism Regimes in Iraq ( Saddam Hussein), Egypt (Abdul Nasser) before that  ect ect ect.

This whole ideology died physically and as an idea in the masses mind.

It got replaced with islamization when the islamic revolt happened in Iran, there was a vacuum of ideoligies and the Khomeini in Iran had a big role in starting this Domino effect of filling the Vaccum of ideologies, Salafit in Saudis, Afghanistan, Muslim brotherhood in multiple arabic countries, Hamas and Hezbollah were created ect.

Now it seems that the domino pieces are going to fall again (it already started falling by Saudi Arabia beginning to be more westrenized and Sisi being the president of egypt after making a coup on the Muslim brotherhood ect.)

But still Hamas is the most big Domino piece, if it falls it will be easier for other pieces to fall, and also the Saudi Israeli peace will change the middle east for ever.

It will be the starting of something new, Ofc, Iran and Qatar should be tackled and i think that will be on the goals list of Saudis and Israelis, they are their common enemy.

After that their will be a vaccum and Saudi Arabia will fill it with whatever agenda they have, And from what i see, i can be a bit optimistic.

 it is always forgotten how easy is to brainwash people, it is always underestimated. Saudi and Qatar were a big part of brainwashing arabs into islamizm, it was very obvious for any third party inspector, Saudi is starting to shifting it's way,but Qatar and Aljazeera are still, so they have to be tackled."," let s skip to the bottom line   debating the history of the region is not only a lost cause, it s actually a red herring when discussing the conflict.   things our ancestors did or didn t do, who said what to who, who thought what, who started, who ended, none of it matters.  this is the first issue, they are still living in the past and it is supported by actions as well, take for example the refugee problem in syria, lebanon and jordan   to some extent  ect.,the avoidance of creating a palestinian state with what they had ect. , their whole strategy is to view all events after 1948 as continuing events. the whole strategy is literally to keep the nakba relevant when it is indeed dead a long time ago.  there has been billions of dollars invested in this strategy, the brainwashing is so severe, and that s why until this day they still believe israel could go away one day. .    so, how do we, given the current situation and that no one is going anywhere, how do we get to peace?  the palestinian side doesn t want peace it wants a ceasfire, it is very idiotic talking about solution when you are the only one who is sitting in the table.  like i always say, if the israeli side woke up norwegian and the palestinian side stayed the same, nothing much will change. if the palestinian side woke up norwegian and the israeli side stayed the same, the whole conflict will be solved!  so now,what is the problem with the palestinian side?

In order to have peace, both sides must be interested in it. Before October 7th, I would say that most Israelis were interested in peace, but the Palestinian leaders dragged their feet.
Currently, none of us want peace.
In order for both sides to want peace in the first place, the Palestinians or their leaders (but preferably both) should:
Condemn Hamas and any terror attacks against Israel immediately. This means dropping all their weapons and dismissing any martyr conceptions that support such actions.
Condemn any party or group that claims peace agreements are only a stepping stone towards a bigger cause, which is to destroy Israel and declare Palestine as a sovereign state. This is a crucial step towards peace since there‚Äôs no point discussing any agreement if that conception still exists among the Palestinians.
Acknowledge Israel as a Jewish state.
Forget about the right of return.
All the above conditions must be met before peace discussions can be anywhere near relevant. If any Palestinian leader ever agrees to even one of these conditions, he (or, God forbid, she) will face ‚Äúsevere consequences‚Äù. I won‚Äôt elaborate further on what severe consequences means.

2024-08-31 13:24:43,Israel,Palestine,1f5lcj4,lktulia,The casual hate towards Israelis because of the war is so fucking disappointing.,"The Second Intifada was twenty+ years ago. That's an entire generation. And for the entire time since then, especially in internationally funded academic circles, Israel has been gratuitously, aggressively reframed to be the neocolonial, white aggressor against the poor, oppressed, brown Palestinians. And Israel has done too little to address either that revisionist reframing of the conflict, or the effects the conflict has on that continuous process of reframed narratives in real time. 

The reality of things has been obscured over those decades. That Israel is a tiny statelet of modern Western values and decolonization that emerged from the ashes of a legacy of 1500 years of alternatively barbaric Arab colonialism (pogroms beyond count whenever the dhimmi Jews got too uppity) and neglectful Arab tyranny (no investment into the region, ever). That history is obscured, selectively distorted and reframed in much so-called 'modern history', written and funded by weaponized antisemites who have tenure at name-brand western universities. Israel isn't an oppressor of a few million Palestinians; it's a survivor of the imperialist, misanthropic desires of 400+ million Arabs who have weaponized a small subfacet of their population as a spearhead against Israel. These are the truths which these people will never willingly allow to see the light of day. 

The West, in the meanwhile, is too distracted with rejecting its own cultural legacy in the name of rejecting racism, and in the process has lost sight of how some cultures are just better than others. And certain powerful factions within the west are taking Russian, Chinese, Qatari, Iranian money in order to act as pawns in peddling these corrupt narratives. All factions that have nothing but enmity for Israel, Israel in its capacity as a home for Jews, or Israel as a potent American ally in a valuable region; take your pick.

That's why all of this is happening.

2024-04-11 03:13:05,Israel,Palestine,1c0x881,kz0vr2m,Why did the UN Split mandatory palestine in 2,"I‚Äôll give you an extremely abridged summary because the history of the region during the 20th century is incredibly complex involving numerous powers and characters fighting for influence. 

By 1947, Britain was practically bankrupt from World War 2 and exhausted by the turmoil in its rapidly collapsing empire (most notably, the situation in India). Both the Arabs and the Jews that were in Mandatory Palestine were engaged in an ethnic conflict that was rapidly increasing in hostility. While both sides were antagonistic to each other, they were united by one thing; their mutual hatred of the British Mandate and their desire to see it end. This resulted in British soldiers stationed there being subject to abuse, terrorism, and violence. Britain, having failed over the previous two decades to convince any of the parties to agree to their various solutions, declared that regardless of anything else, they were retreating from the region. They subsequently handed the issue over to newly formed United Nations to come up with a solution. The UN formed a special committee to thoroughly examine the issue and two proposals were drawn up. The minority view was that the mandate should not be partitioned and instead a single state with a complex system of representation in Parliament should be created. The majority of the committee, however, rejected that proposal as impractical as neither the Jews nor the Arabs desired it and they predicted that it would lead to inevitable civil war as demonstrated by the situation already on the ground. The majority position proposed partitioning the land into two states, one Arab and one Jewish with, however, full economic union and rights to travel between the two (subject to reasonable security concerns). Jerusalem and Bethlehem would be entirely separate from these two states and instead would belong to the international community collectively. The majority position was subsequently presented to the General Assembly as Resolution 181 and adopted with the requisite number of votes. The Jews celebrated the vote but the Arab members of the UN who lost the vote (and the Arabs in Mandatory Palestine) declared that they would not recognize its validity. At the conclusion of the British Mandate, Israel declared independence and the Arab states invaded to join the Arabs already fighting the Jews in the region. Resolution 181 was thus never implemented. And the rest, as they say, is history.","i ll give you an extremely abridged summary because the history of the region during the 20th century is incredibly complex involving numerous powers and characters fighting for influence.   by 1947, britain was practically bankrupt from world war 2 and exhausted by the turmoil in its rapidly collapsing empire  most notably, the situation in india . both the arabs and the jews that were in mandatory palestine were engaged in an ethnic conflict that was rapidly increasing in hostility. while both sides were antagonistic to each other, they were united by one thing  their mutual hatred of the british mandate and their desire to see it end. this resulted in british soldiers stationed there being subject to abuse, terrorism, and violence. britain, having failed over the previous two decades to convince any of the parties to agree to their various solutions, declared that regardless of anything else, they were retreating from the region. they subsequently handed the issue over to newly formed united nations to come up with a solution. the un formed a special committee to thoroughly examine the issue and two proposals were drawn up. the minority view was that the mandate should not be partitioned and instead a single state with a complex system of representation in parliament should be created. the majority of the committee, however, rejected that proposal as impractical as neither the jews nor the arabs desired it and they predicted that it would lead to inevitable civil war as demonstrated by the situation already on the ground. the majority position proposed partitioning the land into two states, one arab and one jewish with, however, full economic union and rights to travel between the two  subject to reasonable security concerns . jerusalem and bethlehem would be entirely separate from these two states and instead would belong to the international community collectively. the majority position was subsequently presented to the general assembly as resolution 181 and adopted with the requisite number of votes. the jews celebrated the vote but the arab members of the un who lost the vote  and the arabs in mandatory palestine  declared that they would not recognize its validity. at the conclusion of the british mandate, israel declared independence and the arab states invaded to join the arabs already fighting the jews in the region. resolution 181 was thus never implemented. and the rest, as they say, is history.","give extremely abridged summary history region 20th century incredibly complex involving numerous powers characters fighting influence. 1947, britain practically bankrupt world war 2 exhausted turmoil rapidly collapsing empire notably, situation india . arabs jews mandatory palestine engaged ethnic conflict rapidly increasing hostility. sides antagonistic other, united one thing mutual hatred british mandate desire see end. resulted british soldiers stationed subject abuse, terrorism, violence. britain, failed previous two decades convince parties agree various solutions, declared regardless anything else, retreating region. subsequently handed issue newly formed united nations come solution. un formed special committee thoroughly examine issue two proposals drawn up. minority view mandate partitioned instead single state complex system representation parliament created. majority committee, however, rejected proposal impractical neither jews arabs desired predicted would lead inevitable civil war demonstrated situation already ground. majority position proposed partitioning land two states, one arab one jewish with, however, full economic union rights travel two subject reasonable security concerns . jerusalem bethlehem would entirely separate two states instead would belong international community collectively. majority position subsequently presented general assembly resolution 181 adopted requisite number votes. jews celebrated vote arab members un lost vote arabs mandatory palestine declared would recognize validity. conclusion british mandate, israel declared independence arab states invaded join arabs already fighting jews region. resolution 181 thus never implemented. rest, say, history.",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1c0x881/why_did_the_un_split_mandatory_palestine_in_2/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1c0x881/why_did_the_un_split_mandatory_palestine_in_2/kz0vr2m,54.85977421271539,-0.9247,1.791759469228055,4.022844518488013,0

Intermingling the climate crisis with the Palestinians is a complete fucking disgrace.

Why the hell does she speak for an entire very important movement?

She should have no voice in any of this, I only want to hear from scientists. Not irrelevant Palestinian voices. Wtf.

For anyone curious, the below is why useful idiots like Greta don‚Äôt know a damn thing about this conflict:

>Hamas leaders in 1993 were recorded on a wiretapped conversation stating that their goal was to deceive the American public into supporting Hamas by appealing to the American left‚Äôs denouncement of oppression.

>Mousa Abu Marzook, a senior Hamas official, formed a far-left academic think tank, The United Association for Studies and Research (UASR), based out of Chicago to start disseminating this deception.

>This organization has ties to Duke, Johns Hopkins, Fordham and the University of Maryland to name a few major universities.

>This is systemic antisemitism that stems directly from an organized surgical operation taking place over the course of the last 30 years.
