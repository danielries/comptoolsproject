2024-10-05 19:28:52,worldnews,Israel,1fwy8g3,lqi4ra5,Netanyahu denounces Macron over calls to stop arms deliveries to Israel,"From The Telegraph:

[Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/01/benjamin-netanyahu-asked-vladimir-putin-stop-iran/), Israel’s prime minister, issued a furious denunciation of [French president Emmanuel Macron](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/03/eu-could-die-says-emmanuel-macron-us-china-nato/) on Saturday over the latter’s calls for a worldwide arms embargo on Israel.

“I have a message for [president Macron](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/emmanuel-macron/),” Mr Netanyahu said in a video address.

“Israel will win with or without” the support of France, the prime minister said, as he cited the threats to Israel on seven fronts.

Referring to Mr Macron’s remarks as a “disgrace”, Mr Netanyahu said France’s “shame will continue long after the war is won”.

He added that “Iran is behind all the threats against us”.

Mr Netanyahu said: “No country in the world would accept such an attack,” as the one Iran delivered on Tuesday, when [200 missiles were fired at Israel](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/02/how-iran-could-breach-israel-air-defences-missiles/).

“Israel will not accept it either. Israel has the duty and the right to defend itself and respond to such attacks – and this is what we are going to do.”

Mr Macron said: “I think that today, the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza.”

Later, he added that he “regrets” Mr Netanyahu’s decision to launch a ground invasion in Lebanon.

The denunciation came as Israel is increasingly confident it has killed the likely successor to Hassan Nasrallah, former Hezbollah leader, in an air strike.

[Contact with Hashem Safieddine has been lost since the Israeli attack on Beirut](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/05/israel-iran-war-lebanon-hezbollah-latest-news/) on Thursday night, a high-level Hezbollah source told AFP.

“We don’t know if he was at the targeted site, or who may have been there with him,” the source said.

Israel’s strike at Hezbollah’s underground intelligence headquarters in the suburb of Dahiyeh involved around 60 tons of bombs, according to Israel’s N12 news.

Saudi TV channel Al Hadath quoted sources who said that “the scope of the attack in Beirut, which was aimed at the culprit Safieddine, leaves no room to escape alive”.

> US Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, said on Tuesday that Iran was a &quot;Dangerous&quot; and &quot;Destabilising&quot; force in the Middle East and Washington was committed to Israel&#039;s security.

> WHY IT&#039;S IMPORTANT. The comments from Harris, who faces Republican former President Donald Trump in the November 5 US election, came hours after Iran fired ballistic missiles at Israel in retaliation for Israel&#039;s military campaign in Lebanon, drawing vows of a sharp response from Israel and the US. No injuries were reported in Israel and Washington called Iran&#039;s attack ineffective.

> Israel&#039;s military campaign in Lebanon is in addition to its war in Gaza that followed a deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Palestinian Hamas militants.

There is so much here that I *refuse* to believe can't be alleviated on a macro level. Does Israel really need to kick these Palestinians off of this land? Is it really reasonable that the Palestinians living there couldn't have gotten permits all this time? Even if they could have and they didn't- we can't issue them permits now? How valuable is this archaeological site when the community was built in the 80s and then the demolition judgement was on pause for the last 7 years after that?

Israel needs some serious self-reflection that I hope its capable of come its next elections. The IDF shouldn't be facilitating this- and it shouldn't be facilitating settler terrorism either. It doesn't matter how many Palestinians do vile murders and rapes and destructions across the country- this *cannot* be the answer- it does not need to be so it shouldn't be.

2024-10-26 10:41:11,worldnews,Israel,1gci9fh,lttxegw,Israel sent message to Iran ahead of attack and warned against response,"Israel sent a message to Iran on Friday ahead of its retaliatory airstrikes warning the Iranians not to respond, three sources with knowledge of the issue told Axios.

*Why it matters:* The Israeli message was an attempt to limit the ongoing exchange of attacks between Israel and Iran and prevent a wider escalation, the sources said.

*Driving the news:* U.S. and Israeli officials said three waves of airstrikes took place on Saturday morning local time.

The first wave focused on Iran's air defense system and the second and third waves focused on missile and drone bases and weapons' productions sites.

Iran said it defeated the Israeli attack and that only ""limited damage"" was done to military targets around the country.

Israeli officials said the attack was in retaliation for Iran's massive ballistic missile attack on October 1.
Behind the scenes: The Israeli message was conveyed to the Iranians through several third parties, the sources said.

""The Israelis made it clear to the Iranians in advance what they are going to attack in general and what they are not going to attack,"" one source told Axios.

Two other sources said Israel warned the Iranians not to respond to the attack and stressed that if Iran does retaliate, Israel would conduct another more significant attack, especially if Israeli civilians are killed or injured.

The Israeli Prime Minister's Office did not respond for a request for comment.

Iran has said it doesn't want a full-blown war with Israel but that it would retaliate if attacked.

On Saturday, IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a briefing with reporters that if Iran escalates in response to the Israeli strikes, Israel will be compelled to retaliate.

A U.S. official said the U.S. didn't participate in the Israeli operation but that if Iran retaliates, the U.S. is ready to defend Israel against such an attack.

""This should be the end of the direct military exchange between Israel and Iran,"" the official added. ""If Iran attacks Israel again there will be consequences. We communicated that directly and indirectly to Iran.""

*What they're saying:* One of the channels for conveying messages to Iran ahead of the Israeli strike was Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldcamp, one source said.

""I spoke with the Iranian Foreign Minister about war and the heightened tensions in the region. Regarding the latter, I urged for restraint. All parties must work to prevent further escalation,"" Veldcamp wrote on X several hours before the Israeli attack.
What to watch: U.S. officials said they expect Iran to respond to the Israeli attack in the coming days but in a limited way that will enable Israel to stop the tit-for-tat cycle.

""It is our aim to accelerate diplomacy and de-escalate tensions in the Middle East region. We urge Iran to cease its attacks on Israel so that this cycle of fighting can end without further escalation,"" National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said.","israel sent a message to

> Nawaf Salam, the president of the International Court of Justice, which is scheduled to release on Friday an opinion in another politically-motivated case targeting Israel, voted 210 times to condemn the Jewish state when he served as Lebanon&#039;s UN ambassador, and delivered inflammatory speeches accusing &quot;Terrorist Jewish organizations&quot; of committing &quot;Organized massacres,&quot; UN Watch, an NGO monitoring the actions of the United Nations and an advocate for Israel, said in a report published on Thursday.

> Israel considered appealing against his appointment in light of his past conduct but decided against it because of the anti-Israel sentiment prevailing in the international judicial body, a decision that has raised some questions because of Salam&#039;s obvious bias.

> In 2014, he accused Israel of committing crimes against humanity and, in 2016, accused Israel of apartheid.

That isn’t how a ceasefire works. You have to discuss the details, to be able to execute the diplomacy, to be able to reach the ceasefire agreement. Not all the way to a final peace treaty, but enough to provide confidence that pausing hostilities is worthwhile.

This is a propaganda statement vs. sincere participation. You can tell because it is pretending the work and negotiation doesn’t need to happen in order for a ceasefire agreement to be reached.

A step in the right direction, but not nearly enough to be real or meaningful.

To put things more bluntly: This is exactly how you (1) enable someone not to participate in the negotiations and then (2) use the fact that they weren’t included in negotiations to violate the resulting ceasefire at their earliest convenience.

2024-10-12 20:52:44,worldnews,Israel,1g293dp,lrmf1dl,Captured documents reveal Hamas’s broader ambition to wreak havoc on Israel,"Yes, and here is what NATO have long assessed to be Hamas’ tactics in this conflict: https://stratcomcoe.org/cuploads/pfiles/hamas_human_shields.pdf

Hamas relies on the Israeli government’s aim to minimise collateral damage, and is also aware of the West’s sensitivity towards civilian casualties. Hamas’ use of human shields is therefore likely aimed at minimising their own vulnerabilities by limiting the Israeli Defense Forces’ (IDF) freedom of action. It is also aimed at gaining diplomatic and public opinion-related leverage, by presenting Israel and the IDF as an aggressor that indiscriminately strikes civilians.

Hamas’ most common uses of human shields include:

1) Firing rockets, artillery, and mortars from or in proximity to heavily populated civilian areas, often from or near facilities which shoula be protected according to the Geneva convention (e.g. schools, hospitals, or mosques).

2) Locating military or security-related infrastructures such as HQs, bases, armouries, access routes, lathes, or defensive positions within or in proximity to civilian areas.
3) Protecting terrorists’ houses and military facilities, or rescuing terrorists who were besieged or warned by the IDF. ⁠
4) Combating the IDF from or in proximity to residential and commercial areas, including using civilians for intelligence gathering missions.

By engaging in these acts, Hamas employs a win-win scenario: if indeed the IDF uses kinetic power, and the number of civilian causalities surges, Hamas can use that as a weapon in the lawfares it conducts. It would be able to accuse the IDF (and Israel) of committing war crimes, which in turn could result in the imposition of a wide array of sanctions. On the other hand, if the IDF limits its use of military power in Gaza to avoid collateral damage Hamas will be less vulnerable to Israeli attacks, and thereby able to protect its assets while continuing to fight.

We all need to start asking ourselves why we are letting them do this. Here is a way to start - by asking this question: https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/s/EKsbYkhRY2

Edit: And Iran’s response to deploying the obvious countermeasure to ballistic missile attacks on civilian population centers is to call it “dangerous escalation”.

> BEIRUT - The Israeli military said Friday it struck the central headquarters of Hezbollah in Beirut, where a series of massive explosions leveled multiple buildings, sending clouds of orange and black smoke billowing in the skies.

> The strikes in the suburbs south of Lebanon&#039;s capital came shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the U.N., vowing that Israel&#039;s campaign against Hezbollah would continue.

> In Gaza, Israel has vowed to dismantle Hamas&#039; military and political regime, but the goal in Lebanon is just to push Hezbollah away from the border with Israel - &quot;Not a high bar like Gaza&quot; in terms of operational objectives, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to military briefing guidelines.

Israel sent troops to bolster its borders with the West Bank to prepare for a [possible ground assault](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/08/05/israel-iran-hamas-war-latest/) orchestrated by Hamas and Iran.

Additional forces were deployed to cities to foil any infiltration attempt, following a deadly knife attack on Sunday that left two people killed in the city of Holon in central Israel, Israel’s Army Radio, run by the armed forces, reported.

It came as Israel was braced for a major attack likely by air from Iran following the [assassination of Ismail Haniyeh](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/07/31/assassination-ismail-haniyeh-tehran-middle-east-peace/), the Hamas leader, in Tehran on Wednesday. 

Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, told G7 allies that an attack, likey with missiles and drones, could begin as early as Monday, sources told US media.

The G7 countries issued a joint statement, urging all involved parties “once again to refrain from perpetuating the current [destructive cycle of retaliatory violence](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/07/29/israel-hamas-war-gaza-lebanon-hezbollah-strikes-latest-news/), to lower tensions and engage constructively toward de-escalation”.

# Iran dismisses attempts to de-escalate

Iran on Monday issued public flight operations notices advising aircrafts to change their routes in a sign that missile and drone launches were imminent. Lufthansa, the German airline giant, said that its flights would avoid Iraqi and Iranian airspace until at least Aug 7.

Tehran has dismissed attempts by Arab nations and the US to de-escalate the situation, saying [it will attack Israel](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/08/04/iranian-attack-on-israel-could-happen-as-early-as-monday/) even if it means sparking a war, the Wall Street Journal reported.

2024-02-19 21:00:37,worldnews,Israel,1auu1ay,kr6yzkr,Israel declares Brazil's Lula persona non grata for comparing Gaza war to Holocaust,"Let's compare the Gaza war with the Holocaust.

Holocaust: Launched as an antisemitic and unprovoked genocide campaign. There were over 6 million Jews killed, out of a European population of about 9 million, about 66% of all Jews in Europe (or about 50x more than Gaza by comparison). There were no military or terrorist deaths. The few who resisted were killed, but don't number very highly, and make up less than 10% of the dead (if I'm being incredibly charitable; I bet they didn't even make up 1%). Those Jews were defenseless, and slaughtered in gas chambers, bullets in their heads, etc., **in an industrial way**.

Gaza war: Launched in response to 10/7. There have been ~28,000 deaths, or about 1.4% of the Gaza population. That's according to Hamas. The best statistics we have available suggest Israel has killed over 10,000 members of Hamas. Many of the dead civilians have been killed because they were being used as human shields, or were killed by Hamas rockets falling short on Gazans themselves, like the Al Ahli Hospital (where one rocket killed over 100 Gazan civilians). Comparable wars with urban fighting, in less dense areas, with a less entrenched enemy, with less use of human shields, frequently see up to 90% of casualties be civilians. In this war, the estimate is somewhere closer to 60% casualties, even ignoring that some of those are due to Hamas rockets.

While individual Gazans may have been killed by soldiers acting illegally in a few cases, this is not the norm or the policy. If it was, then Israel would not have dropped over 60,000 tons of bombs and killed less than 30,000 people, many of them terrorists. When the Allies bombed Dresden in WWII, they dropped 4,000 tons of bombs and killed 25,000 people in two days. When the Nazis liquidated the Warsaw Ghetto, they killed over 250,000 Jews (50-75% of the Jewish population of Warsaw at the time) in less time than this war has gone on. Israel has dropped 15x more bombs than the Allies did on Dresden, a less dense city, and killed roughly the same number of people, many of them terrorists. This suggests clear distinction and targeting of terrorists. If Israel wanted to treat Gaza like the Nazis treated Jews, Gaza would not just be flat, there would be over 1 million casualties, and likely closer to 1.5 million.

There are less than 30,000.

Brazil's Lula has disgraced and inverted the Holocaust to attack Jews with its memory. It is deliberately antisemitic to do so.","let us compare the gaza war with the holocaust. holocaust launched as an antisemitic and unprovoked genocide campaign. there were over 6 million jews killed, out of a european population of about 9 million, about 66 of all jews in europe or about 50x more than gaza by comparison . there were no military or terrorist deaths. the few who resisted were killed, but do not number very highly, and make up less than 10 of the dead if i am being incredibly charitable i bet they did not even make up 1 . those jews were defenseless, and slaughtered in gas chambers, bullets in their heads, etc., in an industrial way . gaza war launched in response to 10 7. there have been 28,000 deaths, or about 1.4 of the gaza population. that is according to hamas. the best statistics we have available suggest israel has killed over 10,000 members of hamas. many of the dead civilians have been killed because they were being used as human shields, or were killed by hamas rockets falling short on gazans themselves, like the al ahli hospital where one rocket killed over 100 gazan civilians . comparable wars with urban fighting, in less dense areas, with a less entrenched enemy, with less use of human shields, frequently see up to 90 of casualties be civilians. in this war, the estimate is somewhere closer to 60 casualties, even ignoring that some of those are due to hamas rockets. while individual gazans may have been killed by soldiers acting illegally in a few cases, this is not the norm or the policy. if it was, then israel would not have dropped over 60,000 tons of bombs and killed less than 30,000 people, many of them terrorists. when the allies bombed dresden in wwii, they dropped 4,000 tons of bombs and killed 25,000 people in two days. when the nazis liquidated the warsaw ghetto, they killed over 250,000 jews 50 75 of the jewish population of warsaw at the time in less time than this war has gone on. israel has dropped 15x more bombs than the allies did on dresden, a less dense city, and killed roughly the same number of people, many of them terrorists. this suggests clear distinction and targeting of terrorists. if israel wanted to treat gaza like the nazis treated jews, gaza would not just be flat, there would be over 1 million casualties, and likely closer to 1.5 million. there are less than 30,000. brazil s lula has disgraced and inverted the holocaust to attack jews with its memory. it is deliberately antisemitic to do so.","let us compar gaza war holocaust. holocaust launch antisemit unprovok genocid campaign. 6 million jew killed, european popul 9 million, 66 jew europ 50x gaza comparison . militari terrorist deaths. resist killed, number veri highly, make less 10 dead incred charit bet even make 1 . jew defenseless, slaughter ga chambers, bullet heads, etc., industri way . gaza war launch respons 10 7. 28,000 deaths, 1.4 gaza population. accord hamas. best statist avail suggest israel ha kill 10,000 member hamas. mani dead civilian kill becaus use human shields, kill hama rocket fall short gazan themselves, like al ahli hospit one rocket kill 100 gazan civilian . compar war urban fighting, less dens areas, less entrench enemy, less use human shields, frequent see 90 casualti civilians. thi war, estim somewher closer 60 casualties, even ignor due hama rockets. individu gazan may kill soldier act illeg cases, thi norm policy. was, israel would drop 60,000 ton bomb kill less 30,000 people, mani terrorists. alli bomb dresden wwii, drop 4,000 ton bomb kill 25,000 peopl two days. nazi liquid warsaw ghetto, kill 250,000 jew 50 75 jewish popul warsaw time less time thi war ha gone on. israel ha drop 15x bomb alli dresden, less dens city, kill roughli number people, mani terrorists. thi suggest clear distinct target terrorists. israel want treat gaza like nazi treat jews, gaza would flat, would 1 million casualties, like closer 1.5 million. less 30,000. brazil lula ha disgrac invert holocaust attack jew memory. deliber antisemit so.",210,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1auu1ay/israel_declares_brazils_lula_persona_non_grata/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1auu1ay/israel_declares_brazils_lula_persona_non_grata/kr6yzkr,34.419951380448,-0.9991

2024-10-21 04:10:16,worldnews,Israel,1g8h9kj,lsyh0hq,Israel gave the White House its demands for ending the war in Lebanon,"Israel gave the U.S. a document last week with its conditions for a diplomatic solution to end the war in Lebanon and allow displaced civilians from both sides of the border to return to their homes, two U.S. officials and two Israeli officials told Axios.

*Why it matters:* The Israeli Prime Minister's Office gave the paper to the White House ahead of President Biden's envoy Amos Hochstein's visit to Beirut on Monday to discuss a diplomatic solution to the conflict, Israeli officials said.

*Behind the scenes:* The U.S. and Israeli officials told Axios Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, who is a confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, sent the document to Hochstein on Thursday.

Israeli officials said the paper came out of discussions Dermer had with the Israeli Ministry of Defense and the Israel Defense Forces about the principles Israel demands be part of any diplomatic solution to end the war with Hezbollah.

One Israeli demand is that the IDF be allowed to engage in ""active enforcement"" to make sure Hezbollah doesn't rearm and rebuild its military infrastructure in the areas of southern Lebanon that are close to the border, an Israeli official said.
The official added that Israel also demands its air force have freedom of operation in Lebanese air space.

*Friction point:* These two demands contradict UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which states that the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) enforce a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.

""We are talking about 1701 with increased enforcement. Our main message is that if the Lebanese army and UNIFIL do more, the IDF will do less and the other way around"", the Israeli official told me.

A U.S. official said it is highly unlikely Lebanon and the international community would agree to these conditions, which would dramatically undermine Lebanon's sovereignty.
The White House and the Israeli embassy in Washington declined to comment.

*Driving the news:* Hochstein is expected to arrive in Beirut on Monday and meet with acting prime minister Najib Mikati, speaker of parliament Nabih Berri and other Lebanese officials and discuss the Israeli demands.

Berri told Al-Arabiya on Sunday that Hochstein's visit is ""the last chance before the U.S. elections to reach a solution"" to the war in Lebanon.
He stressed there is consensus in Lebanon about UN Resolution 1701 and made clear he refuses to amend it in any way, which is effectively what Israel is demanding.

*Between the lines:* Hochstein is pushing for a wide-ranging deployment of the Lebanese armed forces in southern Lebanon as part of every diplomatic solution that ends the war in Lebanon, U.S. and Israeli officials say.

In recent years, the Lebanese army had very limited forces in the area, which was mostly controlled by Hezbollah.

Hochstein wants to have at least 8,000 Lebanese troops deployed in southern Lebanon, the officials said.
The U.S. envoy also wants to upgrade UNIFIL's mandate so it would be able to help the Lebanese army prevent armed individuals or groups who are not under the control of the Lebanese government from being deployed near the border with Israel.

U.S. officials admit that since the 2006 war, UNIFIL barely enforced resolution 1701 and didn't prevent Hezbollah from building wide-ranging military infrastructure in southern Lebanon in violation of the resolution.

*State of play:* On Sunday night ahead of Hochstein's visit, the Israeli Air Force conducted airstrikes across Lebanon against dozens of targets affiliated with Hezbollah's bank, including a building in Beirut, the IDF said.

A senior Israeli intelligence official said in a briefing with reporters that the bank operated independently of the Lebanese financial system and was not under the supervision of the government or the central bank.
According to the Israeli intelligence official, the Hezbollah bank received hundreds of millions of dollars from Iran annually and played a key role in funding the group's operations.","israel gave

officials and two israeli officials told axios. why it matters the israeli prime minister s office gave the paper to the white house ahead of president biden s envoy amos hochstein s visit to beirut on monday to discuss a diplomatic solution to the conflict, israeli officials said. behind the scenes the you.s. and israeli officials told axios israeli minister for strategic affairs ron dermer, who is a confidant of prime minister benjamin netanyahu, sent the document to hochstein on thursday. israeli officials said the paper came out of discussions dermer had with the israeli ministry of defense and the israel defense forces about the principles israel demands be part of any diplomatic solution to end the war with hezbollah. one israeli demand is that the idf be allowed to engage in active enforcement to make sure hezbollah does not rearm and rebuild its military infrastructure in the areas of southern lebanon that are close to the border, an israeli official said. the official added that israel also demands its air force have freedom of operation in lebanese air space. friction point these two demands contradict un security council resolution 1701, which states that the lebanese armed forces laf and the un interim force in lebanon unifil enforce a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah. we are talking about 1701 with increased enforcement. our main message is that if the lebanese army and unifil do more, the idf will do less and the other way around , the israeli official told me. a you.s. official said it is highly unlikely lebanon and the international community would agree to these conditions, which would dramatically undermine lebanon s sovereignty. the white house and the israeli embassy in washington declined to comment. driving the news hochstein is expected to arrive in beirut on monday and meet with acting prime minister najib mikati, speaker of parliament nabih berri and other lebanese officials and discuss the israeli demands. berri told al arabiya on sunday that hochstein s visit is the last chance before the you.s. elections to reach a solution to the war in lebanon. he stressed there is consensus in lebanon about un resolution 1701 and made clear he refuses to amend it in any way, which is effectively what israel is demanding. between the lines hochstein is pushing for a wide ranging deployment of the lebanese armed forces in southern lebanon as part of every diplomatic solution that ends the war in lebanon, you.s. and israeli officials say. in recent years, the lebanese army had very limited forces in the area, which was mostly controlled by hezbollah. hochstein wants to have at least 8,000 lebanese troops deployed in southern lebanon, the officials said. the you.s. envoy also wants to upgrade unifil s mandate so it would be able to help the lebanese army prevent armed individuals or groups who are not under the control of the lebanese government from being deployed near the border with israel. you.s. officials admit that since the 2006 war, unifil barely enforced resolution 1701 and did not prevent hezbollah from building wide ranging military infrastructure in southern lebanon in violation of the resolution. state of play on sunday night ahead of hochstein s visit, the israeli air force conducted airstrikes across lebanon against dozens of targets affiliated with hezbollah s bank, including a building in beirut, the idf said. a senior israeli intelligence official said in a briefing with reporters that the bank operated independently of the lebanese financial system and was not under the supervision of the government or the central bank. according to the israeli intelligence official, the hezbollah bank received hundreds of millions of dollars from iran annually and played a key role in funding the group s operations.","israel gave you.s. document last week condit diplomat solut end war lebanon allow displac civilian side border return homes, two you.s. offici two isra offici told

2024-04-05 19:35:46,worldnews,Israel,1bwqvg7,ky7v215,"Hamas rejects Israel's latest hostage deal proposal, Israel threatens to withdraw from Cairo summit","Hamas rejected [Israel's latest proposal](https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-794951) to cease fighting and release hostages, according to a Friday CNN report.

According to an unnamed diplomat cited by CNN, “They refused and asserted it doesn’t include any reply to their asks.”

According to the diplomat, Hamas believed the “Israeli proposal includes [nothing new](https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-793703), so they see no need to change their proposal,” the official added.

  
Negotiations were supposed to lead to a lasting ceasefire, per the [UN Security Resolution passed last month](https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-793653), and mediators from Egypt, Qatar, and the US have worked to try and broach a deal since the conflict broke out in October.

Negotiators were hoping to achieve a six-week ceasefire and a three-phase framework to secure the release of sick, elderly, and wounded hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners and increased humanitarian aid.

  
Hamas demanded that there be unrestricted return of Gazans to the north and that IDF troops would withdraw.

  
CIA Director William Burns, Mossad Director David Barnea, and Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) Director Ronen Bar were expected to meet in Egypt this weekend to continue ceasefire talks.

However, the latest rejection by Hamas has led Israeli officials to publically wonder whether there is any point in continuing negotiations, according to a report by public broadcaster KAN11.

The trio met last month in Doha for talks with mediators, but no clear breakthrough was reached.

Israel is reportedly pushing both Egypt and Qatar to put pressure on Hamas, with threats to pull out of the Cairo negotiations fully.

Israel has been under increased pressure to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza since the start of the war.

Still, pressure increased last week after the killing of seven foreign aid workers led to the withdrawal of the aid company's services.

  
The pressure led to Israel reopening the Erez crossing for the first time since it was destroyed on October 7, as well as opening up the port in Ashdod to aid deliveries. Kerem Shalom will also be opened.

The cabinet also approved on Friday evening the arrival of Jordanian army trucks carrying humanitarian aid to come through Israeli territory directly to the Gaza Strip.

**EDIT:** Adding more context on the submission below, in case folks want to dispute any specific allegations or call out anything misleading. 

These are the sections of the submission which allegedly evidence genocidal acts committed against Palestinian people:

* Killing Palestinians in Gaza (para 45, pg 31)
* Causing Serious Bodily and Mental Harm to Palestinians in Gaza (para 51, pg 35)
* Mass expulsion from homes and displacement of Palestinians in Gaza (para 55, pg 37)
* Deprivation of access to adequate food and water to Palestinians in Gaza (para 61, pg 40)
* Deprivation of access to adequate shelter, clothes, hygiene and sanitation to Palestinians
in Gaza (para 71, pg 45)
* Deprivation of adequate medical assistance to Palestinians in Gaza (para 76, pg 48)
* Destruction of Palestinian life in Gaza (para 88, pg 54)
* Imposing measures intended to prevent Palestinian births (para 95, pg 57)

The section of the submission allegedly evidencing expressions of genocidal intent against the Palestinian people by Israeli State Officials and others can be found from para 101, pages 59 to 65. Here are some example quotes used:

> * — **President of Israel:** On 12 October 2023, President Isaac Herzog made clear that Israel was not distinguishing between militants and civilians in Gaza, stating in a press conference to foreign media — in relation Palestinians in Gaza, over one million of whom are children: *“It’s an entire nation out there that is responsible. It’s not true this rhetoric about civilians not aware not involved. It’s absolutely not true. … and we will fight until we break their backbone.”*
> 
> * — **Israeli Minister of Heritage:** On 1 November 2023, Amichai Eliyahu posted on Facebook: *“The north of the Gaza Strip, more beautiful than ever. Everything is blown up and flattened, simply a pleasure for the eyes""* 
> 
> * — **Israeli Minister of Defence:** On 9 October 2023, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant in an Israeli Army ‘situation update’ advised that Israel was *“imposing a complete siege on Gaza. No electricity, no food, no water, no fuel. Everything is closed. We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.”* He also informed troops on the Gaza border that he had *“released all the restraints”*, stating in terms that: *“Gaza won’t return to what it was before. We will eliminate everything. If it doesn’t take one day, it will take a week. It will take weeks or even months, we will reach all places.”* He further announced that Israel was moving to “a full-scale response” and that he had “removed every restriction” on Israeli forces.
> 
> * — **Israeli Minister of Finance:** On 8 October 2023, Bezalel Smotrich stated at a meeting of the Israeli Cabinet that *“[w]e need to deal a blow that hasn’t been seen in 50 years and take down Gaza.”*
>

They're big boys, they can make their own way in the world. Give the support to Ukraine where the money goes directly to helping Ukrainians survive. (Plus, Ukraine *appreciates* the help the US provides,... Israel just takes what we give them and thumbs their nose at us.) 

Also, that expensive carrier group should consider moving out of the area. That thing is costly,...

I have no skin in the game ethnically or religiously speaking. I don't hate Muslims or Jews and take each person for who they are. I also have a lot of sympathy for people on either side who are sick and tired of the killing and just want to live peaceful lives out from under the constant threat of death, violence and starvation. 

For most all of my life I've been on Israel's side because I think everyone has a right to exist, but not to the point where I support them committing human rights abuses. That's not an ally I want to help pay for. 

I'm ready for the US to start realigning it's priorities in regards to Israel, and I know I'm not alone in thinking that.","fine, israel,... you do you. personally, i think the us should cut off all funding and military aid to israel. i am all for israel defending itself and it is right to exist, but if bibi and his ultra nationalists want to play like they are russia in gaza , they can do it without us aid. they are big boys, they can make their own way in the world. give the support to ukraine where the money goes directly to helping ukrainians survive. plus, ukraine appreciates the help the us provides,... israel just takes what we give them and thumbs their nose at us. also, that expensive carrier group should consider moving out of the area. that thing is costly,... i have no skin in the game ethnically or religiously speaking. i do not hate muslims or jews and take each person for who they are. i also have a lot of sympathy for people on either side who are sick and tired of the killing and just want to live peaceful lives out from under the constant threat of death, violence and starvation. for most all of my life i have been on israel s side because i think everyone has a right to exist, but not to the point where i support them committing human rights abuses. that is not an ally i want to help pay for. i am ready for the us to start realigning it is priorities in regards to israel, and i know i am not alone in thinking that.","fine, israel,... you. personally, think us cut fund militari aid israel. israel defend right exist, bibi hi ultra nationalist want play like russia gaza , without us aid. big boys, make way world. give support ukrain money goe directli help ukrainian survive. plus, ukrain appreci help us provides,... israel take give thumb nose us. also, expens carrier group consid move area. thing costly,... skin game ethnic religi speaking. hate muslim jew take person are. also lot sympathi peopl either side sick tire kill want live peac live constant threat death, violenc starvation. life israel side becaus think everyon ha right exist, point support commit human right abuses. alli want help pay for. readi us start realign prioriti regard israel, know alon think that.",307,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1c9xls5/usisrael_netanyahu_vows_to_reject_any_us/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1c9xls5/usisrael_netanyahu_vows_to_reject_any_us/l0olc9b,25.698863636363637,0.5357

The powers in the region can't back down because that will show weakness, but they're also too proud and ideologically driven to have normal diplomatic ties. This is the alternative.

In this case, after Israel bulldozed Iran's crown proxy in Hezbollah (specifically Nasrallah), Iran felt like they needed to strike back to maintain their credibility to their allies. However, they also don't want to escalate things to a war because that'll end badly for them since they're no match for the American led coalition in the region. So instead, they decided to launch a flashy barrage of empty missles that make a lot of good noise for PR but actually do little damage. 

This way Iran can pretend that it bested Israel while simultaneously signaling that they don't want things to escalate. This isn't new. We've already seen Iran do this when Soleimani was killed and again when Haniyeh was killed. This time doesn't seem any different. 

The key here is that Biden managed to successfully convince Israel to not escalate further, at least on paper. Israel's retaliation is going to be smaller than the barrage of missles that Iran launched, and Iran's response to this will likely be even smaller, and they'll continue launching smaller and smaller retaliatory strikes until they go back to the status quo.

Longbottom emphasized that Israel's actions are seen as self-defense, unlike the aggressive actions of Russia and Belarus.

Despite these explanations, the decision has been criticized by various quarters, including the Israeli ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, who attended the Hiroshima peace ceremony earlier this week.

The exclusion of Israel has led to a broader diplomatic fallout, with other Western countries such as Australia, Italy, Canada, and the European Union also indicating lower-level representation at the Nagasaki ceremony.

2024-10-09 02:25:48,worldnews,Israel,1fzh7qn,lr1a2iw,Pierre Poilievre says Israel preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons would be a ‘gift’ to humanity,"From the article:

OTTAWA — Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says it would be a “gift” for Israel to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, a statement he made when asked about American opposition to an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear sites.

Outside the House of Commons on Tuesday, Poilievre sidestepped a question about whether an Israeli strike against nuclear facilities in Iran could lead to a direct war between the adversaries. U.S. President Joe Biden, who like Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has urged restraint to prevent the conflict from intensifying further, [told reporters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/biden-says-he-does-not-support-attack-irans-nuclear-sites-2024-10-02/) last week that he does not support an attack on Iran’s nuclear sites. 

Poilievre, however, said Tuesday it would be “the most dangerous and irresponsible thing in the world” to allow Iran — an authoritarian regime that views Israel as illegitimate — to use those facilities to acquire nuclear weapons. 

“If Israel were to stop that genocidal, theocratic, unstable government from acquiring nuclear weapons, it would be a gift by the Jewish state to humanity,” the Conservative leader said. 

Poilievre made the statement moments after he was reprimanded in the House of Commons for claiming, one day earlier, that Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly was pandering to supporters of Hamas, the group Canada deems a terrorist entity that launched the assaults on Oct. 7, 2023 in which more than 1,200 people in Israel were killed and roughly 250 taken hostage. 

On Monday, Poilievre told a Jewish memorial event that Israel should have the right to “proactively” strike Iranian nuclear sites in order to defend itself.","from the article ottawa conservative leader pierre poilievre says it would be a gift for israel to prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons, a statement he made when asked about american opposition to an israeli attack on iranian nuclear sites. outside the house of commons on tuesday, poilievre sidestepped a question about whether an israeli strike against nuclear facilities in iran could lead to a direct war between the adversaries. you.s. president joe biden, who like prime minister justin trudeau has urged restraint to prevent the conflict from intensifying further, told reporters last week that he does not support an attack on iran s nuclear sites. poilievre, however, said tuesday it would be the most dangerous and irresponsible thing in the world to allow iran an authoritarian regime that views israel as illegitimate to use those facilities to acquire nuclear weapons. if israel were to stop that genocidal, theocratic, unstable government from acquiring nuclear weapons, it would be a gift by the jewish state to humanity, the conservative leader said. poilievre made the statement moments after he was reprimanded in the house of commons for claiming, one day earlier, that foreign affairs minister m lanie joly was pandering to supporters of hamas, the group canada deems a terrorist entity that launched the assaults on october 7, 2023 in which more than 1,200 people in israel were killed and roughly 250 taken hostage. on monday, poilievre told a jewish memorial event that israel should have the right to proactively strike iranian nuclear sites in order to defend itself.","articl ottawa conserv leader pierr poilievr say would gift israel prevent iran develop nuclear weapons, statement made ask american opposit isra attack iranian nuclear sites. outsid hous common tuesday, poilievr sidestep question whether isra strike nuclear facil iran could lead direct war adversaries. you.s. presid joe biden, like prime minist justin trudeau ha urg restraint prevent conflict intensifi further, told report last week doe support attack iran nuclear sites. poilievre, however, said tuesday would danger irrespons thing world allow iran authoritarian regim view israel illegitim use facil acquir nuclear weapons. israel stop genocidal, theocratic, unstabl govern acquir nuclear weapons, would gift jewish state humanity, conserv leader said. poilievr made statement moment wa reprimand hous common claiming, one day earlier, foreign affair minist lani joli wa pander support hamas, group canada deem terrorist entiti launch assault octob 7, 2023 1,200 peopl israel kill roughli 250 taken hostage. monday, poilievr told jewish memori event israel right proactiv strike iranian nuclear site order defend itself.",42,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1fzh7qn/pierre_poilievre_says_israel_preventing_iran_from/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1fzh7qn/pierre_poilievre_says_israel_preventing_iran_from/lr1a2iw,59.66580866580867,-0.9847

A small portion of land was taken without consultation with the locals and without any agreement with them, but they still had a majority of their land to themselves.

But no, instead their neighbors decided violence would be their only answer to the situation, and in doing so they lost more land and power all while thousands of people lost their lives, mostly their own. Would they learn? Only a few of them, Jordan and Egypt got smart about it and made peace, as well as some other Muslim states further away. But Palestine and Lebanon just decided their one solution, a failing solution, would be the only idea they entertained and in doing so continued to lose more and more land and power. And as a result Israel got comfortable with what they had taken and people began the lives of several generations on these lands making it harder and harder to leave them. So as a result Israel became less lenient with what they were willing to give back to these neighbouring states.

Now they have next to nothing and they are still using a strategy that has never won them an inch of land back.

2023-11-26 23:33:56,worldnews,Palestine,184nbsv,kawjgo3,Human Rights Watch says rocket misfire likely cause of deadly Gaza hospital blast,"Hmm.... which side do we believe? HRW which explicitly says: 

>It said the findings of its investigation into the explosion were based on a review of photos and videos, satellite imagery and interviews with witnesses and experts.


Or Hamas?

>Senior Hamas official Basem Naim told Reuters all indications pointed to Israel's responsibility, adding that the HRW report was biased towards Israel and was not ""decisive"".

>""HRW hasn't come up with any evidence to support their findings nor eyewitness testimonies nor opinion of independent military exports,"" he said, 

I dug out the HRW report itself, here's some choice quotes:

>The Ministry of Health in Gaza reported that 471 people were killed and 342 injured. Human Rights Watch was unable to corroborate the count, which is significantly higher than other estimates, displays an unusually high killed-to-injured ratio, and appears out of proportion with the damage visible on site.

.

>Gaza authorities appear to be in possession of remnants that would help make a conclusive determination of the munition that exploded at al-Ahli hospital. A photo taken the evening of the explosion shows employees of the Explosive Ordnance Department, a specialized Gaza police unit, working on the crater. A witness who was at the hospital on the evening of the explosion told Human Rights Watch that employees of “the Ministry of Interior took all the shrapnel that was on the site.”

>A Hamas official said the remnants would “soon be shown to the world.” More than a month after the events, this has not happened. Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas leader and deputy minister in the Hamas-led Gaza governing authority, told the media on October 22 that “the missile has dissolved like salt in the water.… It’s vaporized. Nothing is left.” Human Rights Watched noted that substantial portions of munitions typically survive a detonation, even if parts of munitions are designed to break apart and may be made unrecognizable by thermal damage.

Seems to be a rather detailed report, better than I was expecting from HRW at this point

People all over the world and especially across the Middle East *lost their minds over this explosion* near the hospital - there were riots in the streets, attacks on Israeli and US embassies, molotov cocktails were thrown at a synagogue in Berlin, a historic synagogue in Tunisia was burnt down - it was chaos.  The protests were so violent people got killed!  

And it was all because organizations like HRW and mainstream media outlets reported whatever Hamas told them. They were all primed and ready and happy to believe that Israel did something horrible on purpose.  They desperately wanted to report on *anything* that would shift the narrative away from Hamas’s barbarism and depravity on October 7 back to their usual “Israel bad” script. 

**Sometimes a flare goes up and you can see where people really stand.** HRW, Reuters, NYT, the AP, Amnesty were all shown in those early days of the war to be totally irresponsible, dangerously reckless, and biased against Israel.

2024-06-18 10:32:43,worldnews,Palestine,1dijlom,l94v2n7,Hackers linked to Hamas accused of cyberespionage in Palestine,">**Hackers linked to Hamas have been implicated in five cyberespionage campaigns targeting Palestine and Egypt.**

>The evidence emerged in new research from ESET, a cybersecurity company based in Slovakia. Analysts at the firm detected five campaigns spreading trojanized apps to Android users. The attacks focus on user data espionage in Palestine and Egypt.

>The campaigns deploy multistage Android spyware, which ESET calls “AridSpy.”

>To distribute the spyware, the hackers used dedicated websites that impersonate real apps. In Palestine, they primarily harnessed a malicious Palestinian Civil Registry app.

>“In order to gain initial access to the device, the threat actors try to convince their potential victim to install a fake, but functional, app,” said Lukáš Štefanko, the ESET researcher who discovered AridSpy.

>“Once the target clicks the site’s download button, myScript.js, hosted on the same server, is executed to generate the correct download path for the malicious file.”

>ESET attributed the campaigns — with “medium confidence” — to the notorious Arid Viper APT group.

>**Who is Arid Viper?**

>Arid Viper is also known as APT-C-23, Desert Falcons, or Two-tailed Scorpion. Active since at least 2013, the cyberespionage group is notorious for targeting countries in the Middle East. It’s also known for deploying a vast arsenal of malware for Android, iOS, and Windows platforms.

>Cybersecurity vendors have previously linked the group to Hamas. It primarily targets entities in Israel and Palestine, but its reach extends beyond these borders. Analysts have said this hints at a broader geopolitical agenda.

>ESET’s new research, however, makes no accusations of political connections. The company has instead focused on the cyberespionage techniques.

>These techniques enable the hackers to spy on messaging apps and exfiltrate content from devices. ESET said their campaigns began in 2022. Three of them remain active today.","hackers linked to hamas have been implicated in five cyberespionage campaigns targeting palestine and egypt. the evidence emerged in new research from eset, a cybersecurity company based in slovakia. analysts at the firm detected five campaigns spreading trojanized apps to android users. the attacks focus on user data espionage in palestine and egypt. the campaigns deploy multistage android spyware, which eset calls aridspy. to distribute the spyware, the hackers used dedicated websites that impersonate real apps. in palestine, they primarily harnessed a malicious palestinian civil registry app. in order to gain initial access to the device, the threat actors try to convince their potential victim to install a fake, but functional, app, said luk tefanko, the eset researcher who discovered aridspy. once the target clicks the site s download button, myscript.js, hosted on the same server, is executed to generate the correct download path for the malicious file. eset attributed the campaigns with medium confidence to the notorious arid viper apt group. who is arid viper? arid viper is also known as apt c 23, desert falcons, or two tailed scorpion. active since at least 2013, the cyberespionage group is notorious for targeting countries in the middle east. it is also known for deploying a vast arsenal of malware for android, ios, and windows platforms. cybersecurity vendors have previously linked the group to hamas. it primarily targets entities in israel and palestine, but its reach extends beyond these borders. analysts have said this hints at a broader geopolitical agenda. eset s new research, however, makes no accusations of political connections. the company has instead focused on the cyberespionage techniques. these techniques enable the hackers to spy on messaging apps and exfiltrate content from devices. eset said their campaigns began in 2022. three of them remain active today.","hacker link hama implic five cyberespionag campaign target palestin egypt. evid emerg new research eset, cybersecur compani base slovakia. analyst firm detect five campaign spread trojan app android users. attack focu user data espionag palestin egypt. campaign deploy multistag android spyware, eset call aridspy. distribut spyware, hacker use dedic websit imperson real apps. palestine, primarili har malici palestinian civil registri app. order gain initi access device, threat actor tri convinc potenti victim instal fake, functional, app, said luk tefanko, eset research discov aridspy. onc target click site download button, myscript.js, host server, execut gener correct download path malici file. eset attribut campaign medium confid notori arid viper apt group. arid viper? arid viper also known apt c 23, desert falcons, two tail scorpion. activ sinc least 2013, cyberespionag group notori target countri middl east. also known deploy vast arsen malwar android, ios, window platforms. cybersecur vendor previous link group hamas. primarili target entiti israel palestine, reach extend beyond borders. analyst said thi hint broader geopolit agenda. eset new research, however, make accus polit connections. compani ha instead focus cyberespionag techniques. techniqu enabl hacker spi messag app exfiltr content devices. eset said campaign began 2022. three remain activ today.",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1dijlom/hackers_linked_to_hamas_accused_of_cyberespionage/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1dijlom/hackers_linked_to_hamas_accused_of_cyberespionage/l94v2n7,46.17799824919755,0.8419

2024-06-07 15:47:05,worldnews,Palestine,1dadzav,l7jl6or,Israel suggests Labour are ‘rewarding terrorists’ with Palestine manifesto vow,"Israel has reacted with anger to Labour’s manifesto pledge to recognise a Palestinian state before the end of any peace negotiations, suggesting Sir Keir Starmer wants to “reward terrorists”.

A leak of the manifesto revealed by **i** showed Labour would go further than the current UK Government, by supporting statehood for Palestinians “as part of a peace process” rather than after it has concluded.

The Labour leader insisted on Friday that this would not happen while Hamas retained control in Gaza as Israel being “safe and secure” would be a precondition to the move.

But Israeli government spokesman David Mencer told **i**: “Countries embarking on this path should ask themselves this simple question: does their action support peace-makers or does it reward terrorists?

“Eight months to the day since the horrors of 7 October and the Palestinian Authority (PA) have yet to find the time to condemn Hamas.

“All of us here in Israel are left with no other conclusion that the PA thinks what Hamas did on that black day was a good idea.”

As **i** revealed on Thursday, the Labour manifesto – which is being finalised at a meeting in central London – would support Palestinian statehood as part of the Middle East peace process.

The party still backs international efforts to pursue a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians.

During a campaign visit in Brent Cross on Friday, Starmer did not deny that the manifesto pledge would involve recognition during peace negotiations.

He was asked by reporters to categorically rule out Labour recognising Palestine while Hamas retains some control in [Gaza](https://inews.co.uk/topic/gaza?ico=in-line_link), and to explain at what stage in a peace process the party would recognise a state.

The Labour leader said: “Thank you for raising that because it’s very important that I set out for what our position is, which is to recognise Palestine as part of the process to a two-state solution, but part of the process.

“So that means it’s got to be at the right time in the process because we need a viable Palestinian state alongside a safe and secure Israel, to your point.

“We don’t have either of those at the moment. And therefore it’s got to be at the point in the process where we can see both of those outcomes.

“It is important for me to say that recognising Palestine… is not the gift of Israel or anyone else. It is a right but it has to be in the process so that both things happen, a viable Palestinian state and a safe and secure Israel.

“Neither of those things are the position at the moment.”

Inclusion of the pledge in the manifesto is an apparent attempt to stave off Labour losing votes on the left, after Starmer was criticised for being too slow to back an immediate ceasefire in Gaza – which triggered the resignations of Labour councillors.

There were signs that Starmer’s earlier stance had cost Labour some votes in the local and mayoral elections in May.

Following the announcement by Ireland, Spain and Norway that they plan to recognise a state of Palestine, Labour said if elected into government it would begin discussions “in earnest” with “like-minded countries”.

2024-04-10 11:51:44,worldnews,Palestine,1c0jnk2,kywpycb,"US needs Europe to face down Russia and China, says Nato deputy chief","***The Telegraph reports:***

The United States needs its European allies to face down the threat of Russia and China, the deputy secretary general of Nato has told The Telegraph.

There are fears Donald Trump could halt military support for Ukraine if he wins November’s presidential election, or even withdraw Washington’s security guarantee for Europe entirely.

But Mircea Geoană said that with the West locked in an era of “great power competition” with autocratic countries such as Russia, its ally China, North Korea and Iran, the transatlantic alliance was more important than ever.

“As much Europe needs America, America, I think needs all its allies,” he told The Telegraph.

“The strategic reality is that China is a formidable challenger and that Russia and China and all the others together will create massive attempts to disrupt American power.”

**‘Epic struggle’**

He added: “There is an intense aggressive interest from these countries to basically challenge the world order which was introduced after the end of the Second World War.

“In this epic struggle America will need not only its own strength, but also all the allies in the Alliance.”

Mr Trump has warned he would let Russia do “whatever they hell they want” to any Nato member who does not meet its alliance defence spending target of 2 per cent of its economic output.

He was widely criticised for undermining the principle that an attack on one member is one on all the members of the Alliance.

“We worked for four years with president Trump in the White House. The beginning was quite tumultuous,” Mr Geoană said of a period when Mr Trump branded Nato “obsolete”.

But he said that Mr Trump had been “quite positive” about Nato in his final State of the Union address. He added that the race with Joe Biden was “way too close to call”.

Mr Geoană said: “I think strategic logic will prevail and we are confident that America will continue as they’ve done for the last 75 years and continue to be a key player.”

The United States remains the single largest donor of weapons and aid to Ukraine but some believe Europe is not doing enough to help Ukraine.

2024-05-15 15:05:09,worldnews,Palestine,1cslkyx,l45zj1n,Polish foreign minister hits back at Israeli ambassador for UN Palestine vote criticism,">Poland’s foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, has hit back at Israeli ambassador Yacov Livne for criticising Warsaw’s decision to support Palestinian membership of the UN.

>Livne warned that the decision would “harm Poland”. But Sikorski today responded by labelling the remarks “patronising” and saying that it is “the Polish government, not foreign ambassadors, which will decide what is good for Poland”.


>On Friday, Poland was among the majority of 143 countries to vote in favour of supporting Palestine’s bid to become a full member of the UN.

>Only nine countries opposed the motion: the United States, Argentina, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea and Israel itself. A further 25 – including Canada, Germany, Italy, Ukraine and the United Kingdom – abstained.

>Following the vote, Livne took to X to criticise Poland’s decision. He warned that it set a “dangerous precedent of rewarding the aggressor”, that it “continued the 1988 Soviet-led anti-West decision of recognising [a] ‘Palestinian state'”, that it “rewarded Iran and Hamas”, and that it was a “complete violation of the UN charter”.

>“This is a wrong and harmful decision for security, stability, and for Poland,” added the ambassador.


>In an interview on Tuesday morning with Polskie Radio, Sikorski noted that an “ambassador has the right to express the views or interests of his country”. He added, however, that “the Polish government will decide what is good for Poland, not foreign ambassadors”.

>“I think that the ambassador needs to get to know us better and realise that we, as Poles, react badly to a patronising tone,” added the minister.

>He went on to clarify that Poland’s decision at the UN “was not a vote against Israel, it was a vote in favour of a two-state solution in line with the Polish policy of recognising Palestinian statehood that we have been pursuing for more than three decades”.

>Today, Sikorski’s ministry also published posts on social media wishing Israel “peace and prosperity” on the occasion of its independence day.

Understand there are countries such as Russia that consider us foreign adversaries and have been known to manipulate social media content to polarize people especially when it comes to LGBT issues, they especially have roots in conservative social media, where they have the capability to influence people on a mass scale.

It's a national security issue and more should be done to protect the vulnerable LGBT community.

https://www.stalbertgazette.com/local-news/did-reddit-year-end-recaps-expose-russian-interference-in-alberta-8223476

There are clear goals being perpetuated by information warfare campaigns. Especially by Russia, whose information warfare campaigns are wreaking havoc on our society. Some of the obvious goals they have are:

• Balkanize their foreign adversaries. This is evident in the UK leaving the EU, Texas with the US, and Alberta with Canada. This is what Danielle Smith is trying to tap into.

• Have populist politicians support policies that cause chaos and issues in our society. Populist politicians are tapping into these information warfare campaigns to appeal to people whose only access to information about the outside world around them is through social media, where the information warfare is taking place.

• Cause distrust and havoc, by creating specialized propaganda to different segments of the population spread through social media. By polarizing debates through propaganda spread to the masses, Russia has effectively used information warfare to deliver targeted disinformation and appeal to specific demographics. Causing havoc in the LBGT and other minority communities.

• Russia has effectively infiltrated the religious right in America and Canada and empowered them, among many corrupt leaders worldwide through its information warfare.

I can cite my sources if needed.

Putin literally bombed his own people to lock down his power and control. Why should we trust that he is not carrying out horrible atrocities like using information warfare on Canadian citizens to terrorize the LGBT community? He doesn't seem to have any moral qualms with anything and corruption is part of his shtick. He used a nerve agent to publicly poison a turned intelligence asset at a important time in history to signify to his intelligence assets what can be done to them, but in reality, he is just a weak man, who is bitter about the break up of the empire he devoted his life to.

It you want to know more, there is a great documentary series on Netflix about the history that has led to this moment in time. Turning Point - The Bomb and the Cold War on Netflix. Not as much about the information warfare, that I have gleamed through other sources, but it does slightly touch on that.","something is happening all right. understand there are countries such as russia that consider us foreign adversaries and have been known to manipulate social media content to polarize people especially when it comes to lgbt issues, they especially have roots in conservative social media, where they have the capability to influence people on a mass scale. it is a national security issue and more should be done to protect the vulnerable lgbt community. there are clear goals being perpetuated by information warfare campaigns. especially by russia, whose information warfare campaigns are wreaking havoc on our society. some of the obvious goals they have are balkanize their foreign adversaries. this is evident in the uk leaving the eu, texas with the us, and alberta with canada. this is what danielle smith is trying to tap into. have populist politicians support policies that because chaos and issues in our society. populist politicians are tapping into these information warfare campaigns to appeal to people whose only access to information about the outside world around them is through social media, where the information warfare is taking place. because distrust and havoc, by creating specialized propaganda to different segments of the population spread through social media. by polarizing debates through propaganda spread to the masses, russia has effectively used information warfare to deliver targeted disinformation and appeal to specific demographics. causing havoc in the lbgt and other minority communities. russia has effectively infiltrated the religious right in america and canada and empowered them, among many corrupt leaders worldwide through its information warfare. i can cite my sources if needed. putin literally bombed his own people to lock down his power and control. why should we trust that he is not carrying out horrible atrocities like using information warfare on canadian citizens to terrorize the lgbt community? he does not seem to have any moral qualms with anything and corruption is part of his shtick. he used a nerve agent to publicly poison a turned intelligence asset at a important time in history to signify to his intelligence assets what can be done to them, but in reality, he is just a weak man, who is bitter about the break up of the empire he devoted his life to. it you want to know more, there is a great documentary series on netflix about the history that has led to this moment in time. turning point the bomb and the cold war on netflix. not as much about the information warfare, that i have gleamed through other sources, but it does slightly touch on that.","someth happen right. understand countri russia consid us foreign adversari known manipul social media content polar peopl especi come lgbt issues, especi root conserv social media, capabl influenc peopl mass scale. nation secur issu done protect vulner lgbt community. clear goal perpetu inform warfar campaigns. especi russia, whose inform warfar campaign wreak havoc society. obviou goal balkan foreign adversaries. thi evid uk leav eu, texa us, alberta canada. thi daniel smith tri tap into. populist politician support polici becaus chao issu society. populist politician tap inform warfar campaign appeal peopl whose onli access inform outsid world around social media, inform warfar take place. becaus distrust havoc, creat special propaganda differ segment popul spread social media. polar debat propaganda spread masses, russia ha effect use inform warfar deliv target disinform appeal specif demographics. caus havoc lbgt minor communities. russia ha effect infiltr religi right america canada empow them, among mani corrupt leader worldwid inform warfare. cite sourc needed. putin liter bomb hi peopl lock hi power control. whi trust carri horribl atroc like use inform warfar canadian citizen terror lgbt community? doe seem ani moral qualm anyth corrupt part hi shtick. use nerv agent publicli poison turn intellig asset import time histori signifi hi intellig asset done them, reality, weak man, bitter break empir devot hi life to. want know more, great documentari seri netflix histori ha led thi moment time. turn point bomb cold war netflix. much inform warfare, gleam sources, doe slightli touch that.",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1c22coe/un_speaks_of_existential_threat_to_the_people_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1c22coe/un_speaks_of_existential_threat_to_the_people_of/kz9fzjk,48.17132867132867,-0.6833

No other group of people in the world have a multi billion organisation dedicated to babysitting them. Whilst there are peoples in other regions who deserve it just as much. Instead, let the global UN do it's work there.

The UNRWA is a self sustaining machine that employs thousands. It's in their best interest to not fully resolve the situation, to not create meaningful solutions to long term changes in Palestina that fight extremism, religious and economic inequality. Instead of fostering growth and sustainable relationships with Israel they fund things that often have no long term benefit. But why would they? They'll all be without jobs and money if they solve the issues on the ground.

No? That was never the purpose of the UN. It exists so that states have a viable alternative to war as a means of conflict resolution. *A UN ambassador should know this!* The Korean War, the Suez Crisis, the Invasion of Kuwait are all examples of the UN at full capacity. The only reason the UN has dropped the ball so many times is because the Security Council is treated as a dick measuring contest by the Permanent 5.

Just look at Ukraine, under the UN charter every member state is - *theoretically* \- obligated to commit forces to aid in their defensive war. However, the General Assembly can only request that the Security Council invoke the collective defense clause. That just isn't possible 99% of the time because one of the P5 always vetoes it. In the case of the Gulf War, the Soviets joined France, the United Kingdom, and the United States in approving the collective defense request. China abstained.

Whenever the P5 put their own disagreements aside, the UN functions. There are solutions to that, but to say the UN has failed when our planet hasn't been reduced to large swathes radioactive wasteland is complete bullshit.","the un was founded on the ashes of the holocaust to prevent atrocities, erdan emphasized. it is looked at as the bastion of civilization, a moral compass that all nations should follow. sadly, the un has failed spectacularly to carry out its mandate. no? that was never the purpose of the un. it exists so that states have a viable alternative to war as a means of conflict resolution. a un ambassador should know this! the korean war, the suez crisis, the invasion of kuwait are all examples of the un at full capacity. the only reason the un has dropped the ball so many times is because the security council is treated as a dick measuring contest by the permanent 5. just look at ukraine, under the un charter every member state is theoretically obligated to commit forces to aid in their defensive war. however, the general assembly can only request that the security council invoke the collective defense clause. that just is not possible 99 of the time because one of the p5 always vetoes it. in the case of the gulf war, the soviets joined france, the united kingdom, and the united states in approving the collective defense request. china abstained. whenever the p5 put their own disagreements aside, the un functions. there are solutions to that, but to say the un has failed when our planet has not been reduced to large swathes radioactive wasteland is complete bullshit.","un wa found ash holocaust prevent atrocities, erdan emphasized. look bastion civilization, moral compass nation follow. sadly, un ha fail spectacularli carri mandate. no? wa never purpos un. exist state viabl altern war mean conflict resolution. un ambassador know this! korean war, suez crisis, invas kuwait exampl un full capacity. onli reason un ha drop ball mani time becaus secur council treat dick measur contest perman 5. look ukraine, un charter everi member state theoret oblig commit forc aid defens war. however, gener assembl onli request secur council invok collect defens clause. possibl 99 time becaus one p5 alway veto it. case gulf war, soviet join france, unit kingdom, unit state approv collect defens request. china abstained. whenev p5 put disagr aside, un functions. solut that, say un ha fail planet ha reduc larg swath radioact wasteland complet bullshit.",18,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/18cvr4z/the_un_has_failed_its_head_needs_to_resign/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/18cvr4z/the_un_has_failed_its_head_needs_to_resign/kcegbvh,39.5051652892562,-0.9694

But even that moral support would be very difficult to provide. Hamas was able to gain power in Gaza because the people lost hope for any other solution to their problems. There doesn't seem to be an understanding in Israel that the Oslo accords were already very optimistic about how little Palestine could survive on, and that it's simply not possible to create a Palestinian state with less. Quite the opposite, the West Bank is still shrinking, and it seems as though the Palestinian Archipelago of more than 100 disconnected West Bank enclaves will continue to shrink and remain Bantustans indefinitely.

Right now, they cannot even promise Gaza that they'll be economically integrated as a Bantustan, let alone become a stable state. Just bringing Gaza up to being only as bad as the Palestinian West Bank would take decades of work with an annual budget twice the PA's entire GDP. 

It's not something the PA can achieve. If they try, they'll fail, and lose any credibility they have as moderate voices advocating less extreme forms of resistance. The only real solution to this is to build a Gaza that can be economically integrated with its neighbors, with real opportunities, and a tax base capable of resisting extremist groups. And that kind of nation building takes a real country funding and performing it, not an organization with a budget the size of a small suburban mayor's office.","under the current circumstances, it would be an impossible task. the palestinian authority has a gdp the size of a small town. its resources are spread to the breaking point just managing ongoing west bank displacements. they have no experience in counterinsurgency, and no operational capacity for aid delivery. at best, they could deliver moral support to an israeli occupation and reconstruction effort, if israel was going to commit to funding and staffing it. but even that moral support would be very difficult to provide. hamas was able to gain power in gaza because the people lost hope for any other solution to their problems. there does not seem to be an understanding in israel that the oslo accords were already very optimistic about how little palestine could survive on, and that it is simply not possible to create a palestinian state with less. quite the opposite, the west bank is still shrinking, and it seems as though the palestinian archipelago of more than 100 disconnected west bank enclaves will continue to shrink and remain bantustans indefinitely. right now, they cannot even promise gaza that they will be economically integrated as a bantustan, let alone become a stable state. just bringing gaza up to being only as bad as the palestinian west bank would take decades of work with an annual budget twice the pa s entire gdp. it is not something the pa can achieve. if they try, they will fail, and lose any credibility they have as moderate voices advocating less extreme forms of resistance. the only real solution to this is to build a gaza that can be economically integrated with its neighbors, with real opportunities, and a tax base capable of resisting extremist groups. and that kind of nation building takes a real country funding and performing it, not an organization with a budget the size of a small suburban mayor s office.","current circumstances, would imposs task. palestinian author ha gdp size small town. resourc spread break point manag ongo west bank displacements. experi counterinsurgency, oper capac aid delivery. best, could deliv moral support isra occup reconstruct effort, israel wa go commit fund staf it. even moral support would veri difficult provide. hama wa abl gain power gaza becaus peopl lost hope ani solut problems. doe seem understand israel oslo accord alreadi veri optimist littl palestin could surviv on, simpli possibl creat palestinian state less. quit opposite, west bank still shrinking, seem though palestinian archipelago 100 disconnect west bank enclav continu shrink remain bantustan indefinitely. right now, cannot even promis gaza econom integr bantustan, let alon becom stabl state. bring gaza onli bad palestinian west bank would take decad work annual budget twice pa entir gdp. someth pa achieve. try, fail, lose ani credibl moder voic advoc less extrem form resistance. onli real solut thi build gaza econom integr neighbors, real opportunities, tax base capabl resist extremist groups. kind nation build take real countri fund perform it, organ budget size small suburban mayor office.",20,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/17odc83/palestinian_authority_should_play_key_role_in_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/17odc83/palestinian_authority_should_play_key_role_in_a/k7y4vwh,44.161724500525764,0.223

There are more cases, there's a thread in Indian subreddit that compiled multiple cases of gangrapes & paedophilic rapes in just 24 hours happened in India's Independence day.

Now add the institutional gang rape, brutal torture & murder of the Kolkata doctor & the institution itself trying to cover it up, there's no hope for India.

Another rape happened related to this Kolkata case. This time another medical student got raped as she was protesting for the victim of gangrape in Kolkata 

Yes, India is facing a rape crisis. It became such a common occurrence that people grew desensitized to these types of news. Many rapes reported in regional news don't even make it to national coverage. This has always been the case. However, thanks to social media, international audiences are now becoming aware of it. India deserves to be shamed on the world stage for the government to take action regarding law and order. The Indian government doesn't care about local protests because they eventually die down until the next horrific crime makes the news. But the Indian government does care about its perception abroad. Don't let any extreme Indian nationalist tell you that shaming India for rapes is racism.
