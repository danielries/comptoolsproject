2024-10-05 19:28:52,worldnews,Israel,1fwy8g3,lqi4ra5,Netanyahu denounces Macron over calls to stop arms deliveries to Israel,"From The Telegraph:

[Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/01/benjamin-netanyahu-asked-vladimir-putin-stop-iran/), Israel’s prime minister, issued a furious denunciation of [French president Emmanuel Macron](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/03/eu-could-die-says-emmanuel-macron-us-china-nato/) on Saturday over the latter’s calls for a worldwide arms embargo on Israel.

“I have a message for [president Macron](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/emmanuel-macron/),” Mr Netanyahu said in a video address.

“Israel will win with or without” the support of France, the prime minister said, as he cited the threats to Israel on seven fronts.

Referring to Mr Macron’s remarks as a “disgrace”, Mr Netanyahu said France’s “shame will continue long after the war is won”.

He added that “Iran is behind all the threats against us”.

Mr Netanyahu said: “No country in the world would accept such an attack,” as the one Iran delivered on Tuesday, when [200 missiles were fired at Israel](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/02/how-iran-could-breach-israel-air-defences-missiles/).

“Israel will not accept it either. Israel has the duty and the right to defend itself and respond to such attacks – and this is what we are going to do.”

Mr Macron said: “I think that today, the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza.”

Later, he added that he “regrets” Mr Netanyahu’s decision to launch a ground invasion in Lebanon.

The denunciation came as Israel is increasingly confident it has killed the likely successor to Hassan Nasrallah, former Hezbollah leader, in an air strike.

[Contact with Hashem Safieddine has been lost since the Israeli attack on Beirut](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/05/israel-iran-war-lebanon-hezbollah-latest-news/) on Thursday night, a high-level Hezbollah source told AFP.

“We don’t know if he was at the targeted site, or who may have been there with him,” the source said.

Israel’s strike at Hezbollah’s underground intelligence headquarters in the suburb of Dahiyeh involved around 60 tons of bombs, according to Israel’s N12 news.

Saudi TV channel Al Hadath quoted sources who said that “the scope of the attack in Beirut, which was aimed at the culprit Safieddine, leaves no room to escape alive”.

Reuters quoted Lebanese security sources who said Israeli strikes on Dahiyeh have kept rescue workers from scouring the site of the attack.

Hezbollah has made no comment since the attack. 

Lt Col Nadav Shoshani said on Friday that the Israeli military was still assessing the Thursday night air strikes.","from the telegraph    benjamin netanyahu   israel s prime minister, issued a furious denunciation of  french president emmanuel macron   on saturday over the latter s calls for a worldwide arms embargo on israel.   i have a message for  president macron   mr netanyahu said in a video address.   israel will win with or without  the support of france, the prime minister said, as he cited the threats to israel on seven fronts.  referring to mr macron s remarks as a  disgrace , mr netanyahu said france s  shame will continue long after the war is won .  he added that  iran is behind all the threats against us .  mr netanyahu said   no country in the world would accept such an attack,  as the one iran delivered on tuesday, when  200 missiles were fired at israel     israel will not accept it either. israel has the duty and the right to defend itself and respond to such attacks   and this is what we are going to do.   mr macron said   i think that today, the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in gaza.   later, he added that he  regrets  mr netanyahu s decision to launch a ground invasion in lebanon.  the denunciation came as israel is increasingly confident it has killed the likely successor to hassan nasrallah, former hezbollah leader, in an air strike.   contact with hashem safieddine has been lost since the israeli attack on beirut   on thursday night, a high level hezbollah source told afp.   we don t know if he was at the targeted site, or who may have been there with him,  the source said.  israel s strike at hezbollah s underground intelligence headquarters in the suburb of dahiyeh involved around 60 tons of bombs, according to israel s n12 news.  saudi tv channel al hadath quoted sources who said that  the scope of the attack in beirut, which was aimed at the culprit safieddine, leaves no room to escape alive .  reuters quoted lebanese security sources who said israeli strikes on dahiyeh have kept rescue workers from scouring the site of the attack.  hezbollah has made no comment since the attack.   lt col nadav shoshani said on friday that the israeli military was still assessing the thursday night air strikes.","telegraph benjamin netanyahu israel prime minister, issued furious denunciation french president emmanuel macron saturday latter calls worldwide arms embargo israel. message president macron mr netanyahu said video address. israel win without support france, prime minister said, cited threats israel seven fronts. referring mr macron remarks disgrace , mr netanyahu said france shame continue long war . added iran behind threats us . mr netanyahu said country world would accept attack, one iran delivered tuesday, 200 missiles fired israel israel accept either. israel duty right defend respond attacks going do. mr macron said think today, priority return political solution, stop delivering weapons fight gaza. later, added regrets mr netanyahu decision launch ground invasion lebanon. denunciation came israel increasingly confident killed likely successor hassan nasrallah, former hezbollah leader, air strike. contact hashem safieddine lost since israeli attack beirut thursday night, high level hezbollah source told afp. know targeted site, may him, source said. israel strike hezbollah underground intelligence headquarters suburb dahiyeh involved around 60 tons bombs, according israel n12 news. saudi tv channel al hadath quoted sources said scope attack beirut, aimed culprit safieddine, leaves room escape alive . reuters quoted lebanese security sources said israeli strikes dahiyeh kept rescue workers scouring site attack. hezbollah made comment since attack. lt col nadav shoshani said friday israeli military still assessing thursday night air strikes.",394,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1fwy8g3/netanyahu_denounces_macron_over_calls_to_stop/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1fwy8g3/netanyahu_denounces_macron_over_calls_to_stop/lqi4ra5,44.19296607531901,-0.9917,5.976350909297934

> US Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, said on Tuesday that Iran was a &quot;Dangerous&quot; and &quot;Destabilising&quot; force in the Middle East and Washington was committed to Israel&#039;s security.

> WHY IT&#039;S IMPORTANT. The comments from Harris, who faces Republican former President Donald Trump in the November 5 US election, came hours after Iran fired ballistic missiles at Israel in retaliation for Israel&#039;s military campaign in Lebanon, drawing vows of a sharp response from Israel and the US. No injuries were reported in Israel and Washington called Iran&#039;s attack ineffective.

> Israel&#039;s military campaign in Lebanon is in addition to its war in Gaza that followed a deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Palestinian Hamas militants.

2024-10-26 10:41:11,worldnews,Israel,1gci9fh,lttxegw,Israel sent message to Iran ahead of attack and warned against response,"Israel sent a message to Iran on Friday ahead of its retaliatory airstrikes warning the Iranians not to respond, three sources with knowledge of the issue told Axios.

*Why it matters:* The Israeli message was an attempt to limit the ongoing exchange of attacks between Israel and Iran and prevent a wider escalation, the sources said.

*Driving the news:* U.S. and Israeli officials said three waves of airstrikes took place on Saturday morning local time.

The first wave focused on Iran's air defense system and the second and third waves focused on missile and drone bases and weapons' productions sites.

Iran said it defeated the Israeli attack and that only ""limited damage"" was done to military targets around the country.

Israeli officials said the attack was in retaliation for Iran's massive ballistic missile attack on October 1.
Behind the scenes: The Israeli message was conveyed to the Iranians through several third parties, the sources said.

""The Israelis made it clear to the Iranians in advance what they are going to attack in general and what they are not going to attack,"" one source told Axios.

Two other sources said Israel warned the Iranians not to respond to the attack and stressed that if Iran does retaliate, Israel would conduct another more significant attack, especially if Israeli civilians are killed or injured.

The Israeli Prime Minister's Office did not respond for a request for comment.

Iran has said it doesn't want a full-blown war with Israel but that it would retaliate if attacked.

On Saturday, IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a briefing with reporters that if Iran escalates in response to the Israeli strikes, Israel will be compelled to retaliate.

A U.S. official said the U.S. didn't participate in the Israeli operation but that if Iran retaliates, the U.S. is ready to defend Israel against such an attack.

""This should be the end of the direct military exchange between Israel and Iran,"" the official added. ""If Iran attacks Israel again there will be consequences. We communicated that directly and indirectly to Iran.""

*What they're saying:* One of the channels for conveying messages to Iran ahead of the Israeli strike was Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldcamp, one source said.

""I spoke with the Iranian Foreign Minister about war and the heightened tensions in the region. Regarding the latter, I urged for restraint. All parties must work to prevent further escalation,"" Veldcamp wrote on X several hours before the Israeli attack.
What to watch: U.S. officials said they expect Iran to respond to the Israeli attack in the coming days but in a limited way that will enable Israel to stop the tit-for-tat cycle.

""It is our aim to accelerate diplomacy and de-escalate tensions in the Middle East region. We urge Iran to cease its attacks on Israel so that this cycle of fighting can end without further escalation,"" National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said.","israel sent a message to

In the last 24 hours, the following has happened:

- Smotrich freezes all the tax money payable the Palestinian Authority from Palestinian imports+exports, intending to cause its collapse and calls for settlements in Area A area such as Jenin. Even though the PA has literally killed and arrested hundreds of PIJ+Hamas terrorists over the past several months in the West Bank and has allowed the IDF to conduct raids against terrorists in Area B+Area A areas

> Israel considered appealing against his appointment in light of his past conduct but decided against it because of the anti-Israel sentiment prevailing in the international judicial body, a decision that has raised some questions because of Salam&#039;s obvious bias.

> In 2014, he accused Israel of committing crimes against humanity and, in 2016, accused Israel of apartheid.

2024-04-13 21:08:04,worldnews,Israel,1c3c1la,kzfurng,/r/worldnews Live Thread: Iran begins attack on Israel,"For those just joining us. 

Several hours ago, Iran and possibly the Houthis have launched around 100 confirmed pusher propeller drones, which fly at about the speed of a Cessna. It will take them around 9 hours to reach Israel. Iran more recently has launched cruise missiles, which should take about three hours to reach Israel.  Iran's ballistic missiles can hit Israel in 12 minutes.  

The prediction is that they will time all of these attack types to hit Israel at the same time.

2024-10-12 20:52:44,worldnews,Israel,1g293dp,lrmf1dl,Captured documents reveal Hamas’s broader ambition to wreak havoc on Israel,"Yes, and here is what NATO have long assessed to be Hamas’ tactics in this conflict: https://stratcomcoe.org/cuploads/pfiles/hamas_human_shields.pdf

Hamas relies on the Israeli government’s aim to minimise collateral damage, and is also aware of the West’s sensitivity towards civilian casualties. Hamas’ use of human shields is therefore likely aimed at minimising their own vulnerabilities by limiting the Israeli Defense Forces’ (IDF) freedom of action. It is also aimed at gaining diplomatic and public opinion-related leverage, by presenting Israel and the IDF as an aggressor that indiscriminately strikes civilians.

Hamas’ most common uses of human shields include:

1) Firing rockets, artillery, and mortars from or in proximity to heavily populated civilian areas, often from or near facilities which shoula be protected according to the Geneva convention (e.g. schools, hospitals, or mosques).

2) Locating military or security-related infrastructures such as HQs, bases, armouries, access routes, lathes, or defensive positions within or in proximity to civilian areas.
3) Protecting terrorists’ houses and military facilities, or rescuing terrorists who were besieged or warned by the IDF. ⁠
4) Combating the IDF from or in proximity to residential and commercial areas, including using civilians for intelligence gathering missions.

By engaging in these acts, Hamas employs a win-win scenario: if indeed the IDF uses kinetic power, and the number of civilian causalities surges, Hamas can use that as a weapon in the lawfares it conducts. It would be able to accuse the IDF (and Israel) of committing war crimes, which in turn could result in the imposition of a wide array of sanctions. On the other hand, if the IDF limits its use of military power in Gaza to avoid collateral damage Hamas will be less vulnerable to Israeli attacks, and thereby able to protect its assets while continuing to fight.

We all need to start asking ourselves why we are letting them do this. Here is a way to start - by asking this question: https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/s/EKsbYkhRY2

Edit: And Iran’s response to deploying the obvious countermeasure to ballistic missile attacks on civilian population centers is to call it “dangerous escalation”.

> The strikes in the suburbs south of Lebanon&#039;s capital came shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the U.N., vowing that Israel&#039;s campaign against Hezbollah would continue.

> In Gaza, Israel has vowed to dismantle Hamas&#039; military and political regime, but the goal in Lebanon is just to push Hezbollah away from the border with Israel - &quot;Not a high bar like Gaza&quot; in terms of operational objectives, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to military briefing guidelines.

2024-08-05 13:21:02,worldnews,Israel,1eknlwj,lglqrzd,IDF prepares for 'infiltration' ground assault on Israel,"***The Telegraph reports:***

Israel sent troops to bolster its borders with the West Bank to prepare for a [possible ground assault](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/08/05/israel-iran-hamas-war-latest/) orchestrated by Hamas and Iran.

Additional forces were deployed to cities to foil any infiltration attempt, following a deadly knife attack on Sunday that left two people killed in the city of Holon in central Israel, Israel’s Army Radio, run by the armed forces, reported.

It came as Israel was braced for a major attack likely by air from Iran following the [assassination of Ismail Haniyeh](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/07/31/assassination-ismail-haniyeh-tehran-middle-east-peace/), the Hamas leader, in Tehran on Wednesday. 

Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, told G7 allies that an attack, likey with missiles and drones, could begin as early as Monday, sources told US media.

The G7 countries issued a joint statement, urging all involved parties “once again to refrain from perpetuating the current [destructive cycle of retaliatory violence](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/07/29/israel-hamas-war-gaza-lebanon-hezbollah-strikes-latest-news/), to lower tensions and engage constructively toward de-escalation”.

# Iran dismisses attempts to de-escalate

Iran on Monday issued public flight operations notices advising aircrafts to change their routes in a sign that missile and drone launches were imminent. Lufthansa, the German airline giant, said that its flights would avoid Iraqi and Iranian airspace until at least Aug 7.

Tehran has dismissed attempts by Arab nations and the US to de-escalate the situation, saying [it will attack Israel](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/08/04/iranian-attack-on-israel-could-happen-as-early-as-monday/) even if it means sparking a war, the Wall Street Journal reported.

And it is

The report effectively says “there might have been a militant” so regardless of who else was in the vehicles we can destroy them: there is no proportionality at all

Which has been an issue raised time and time again:  the number of civilian deaths to militants appears excessive, the degree of infrastructure destruction is extreme. 

They claim the soldiers were not aware of the charity vehicles, it beggars belief that’s the case - but accepting that, what exactly are these aid agencies meant to do to prevent similar happening again?

They also claim that because it was night the drones could not see that the vehicles were labeled with the charity - I don’t believe that at all.

> Military spokespeople said that under the Israeli army’s rules of engagement, officers must have more than one reason for identifying someone as a target before they can be hit.

That observation turned out to be untrue, military officials said.

> The army said the colonel and the major were dismissed, while three other officers were reprimanded, the most senior of whom was the head of the Southern Command.

> The investigation, headed by Yoav Har-Even, a retired general, found two major areas of wrongdoing.
> It faulted officers for failing to read messages alerting troops that cars, not aid trucks, would carry workers from the charity away from the warehouse where aid was distributed. As a result, the cars that were targeted were misidentified as transporting militants.

> The army also faulted a major who identified the strike target and a colonel who approved the strike for acting with insufficient information.

> The army said the order was given after one of the passengers inside a car was identified as a gunman. It said troops became suspicious because a gunman had been seen on the roof of one of the delivery trucks on the way to the warehouse.

2024-02-19 21:00:37,worldnews,Israel,1auu1ay,kr6yzkr,Israel declares Brazil's Lula persona non grata for comparing Gaza war to Holocaust,"Let's compare the Gaza war with the Holocaust.

Holocaust: Launched as an antisemitic and unprovoked genocide campaign. There were over 6 million Jews killed, out of a European population of about 9 million, about 66% of all Jews in Europe (or about 50x more than Gaza by comparison). There were no military or terrorist deaths. The few who resisted were killed, but don't number very highly, and make up less than 10% of the dead (if I'm being incredibly charitable; I bet they didn't even make up 1%). Those Jews were defenseless, and slaughtered in gas chambers, bullets in their heads, etc., **in an industrial way**.

Gaza war: Launched in response to 10/7. There have been ~28,000 deaths, or about 1.4% of the Gaza population. That's according to Hamas. The best statistics we have available suggest Israel has killed over 10,000 members of Hamas. Many of the dead civilians have been killed because they were being used as human shields, or were killed by Hamas rockets falling short on Gazans themselves, like the Al Ahli Hospital (where one rocket killed over 100 Gazan civilians). Comparable wars with urban fighting, in less dense areas, with a less entrenched enemy, with less use of human shields, frequently see up to 90% of casualties be civilians. In this war, the estimate is somewhere closer to 60% casualties, even ignoring that some of those are due to Hamas rockets.

While individual Gazans may have been killed by soldiers acting illegally in a few cases, this is not the norm or the policy. If it was, then Israel would not have dropped over 60,000 tons of bombs and killed less than 30,000 people, many of them terrorists. When the Allies bombed Dresden in WWII, they dropped 4,000 tons of bombs and killed 25,000 people in two days. When the Nazis liquidated the Warsaw Ghetto, they killed over 250,000 Jews (50-75% of the Jewish population of Warsaw at the time) in less time than this war has gone on. Israel has dropped 15x more bombs than the Allies did on Dresden, a less dense city, and killed roughly the same number of people, many of them terrorists. This suggests clear distinction and targeting of terrorists. If Israel wanted to treat Gaza like the Nazis treated Jews, Gaza would not just be flat, there would be over 1 million casualties, and likely closer to 1.5 million.

There are less than 30,000.

Brazil's Lula has disgraced and inverted the Holocaust to attack Jews with its memory. It is deliberately antisemitic to do so.","let s compare the gaza war with the holocaust.  holocaust  launched as an antisemitic and unprovoked genocide campaign. there were over 6 million jews killed, out of a european population of about 9 million, about 66  of all jews in europe  or about 50x more than gaza by comparison . there were no military or terrorist deaths. the few who resisted were killed, but don t number very highly, and make up less than 10  of the dead  if i m being incredibly charitable  i bet they didn t even make up 1  . those jews were defenseless, and slaughtered in gas chambers, bullets in their heads, etc.,   in an industrial way  .  gaza war  launched in response to 10 7. there have been  28,000 deaths, or about 1.4  of the gaza population. that s according to hamas. the best statistics we have available suggest israel has killed over 10,000 members of hamas. many of the dead civilians have been killed because they were being used as human shields, or were killed by hamas rockets falling short on gazans themselves, like the al ahli hospital  where one rocket killed over 100 gazan civilians . comparable wars with urban fighting, in less dense areas, with a less entrenched enemy, with less use of human shields, frequently see up to 90  of casualties be civilians. in this war, the estimate is somewhere closer to 60  casualties, even ignoring that some of those are due to hamas rockets.  while individual gazans may have been killed by soldiers acting illegally in a few cases, this is not the norm or the policy. if it was, then israel would not have dropped over 60,000 tons of bombs and killed less than 30,000 people, many of them terrorists. when the allies bombed dresden in wwii, they dropped 4,000 tons of bombs and killed 25,000 people in two days. when the nazis liquidated the warsaw ghetto, they killed over 250,000 jews  50 75  of the jewish population of warsaw at the time  in less time than this war has gone on. israel has dropped 15x more bombs than the allies did on dresden, a less dense city, and killed roughly the same number of people, many of them terrorists. this suggests clear distinction and targeting of terrorists. if israel wanted to treat gaza like the nazis treated jews, gaza would not just be flat, there would be over 1 million casualties, and likely closer to 1.5 million.  there are less than 30,000.  brazil s lula has disgraced and inverted the holocaust to attack jews with its memory. it is deliberately antisemitic to do so.","let compare gaza war holocaust. holocaust launched antisemitic unprovoked genocide campaign. 6 million jews killed, european population 9 million, 66 jews europe 50x gaza comparison . military terrorist deaths. resisted killed, number highly, make less 10 dead incredibly charitable bet even make 1 . jews defenseless, slaughtered gas chambers, bullets heads, etc., industrial way . gaza war launched response 10 7. 28,000 deaths, 1.4 gaza population. according hamas. best statistics available suggest israel killed 10,000 members hamas. many dead civilians killed used human shields, killed hamas rockets falling short gazans themselves, like al ahli hospital one rocket killed 100 gazan civilians . comparable wars urban fighting, less dense areas, less entrenched enemy, less use human shields, frequently see 90 casualties civilians. war, estimate somewhere closer 60 casualties, even ignoring due hamas rockets. individual gazans may killed soldiers acting illegally cases, norm policy. was, israel would dropped 60,000 tons bombs killed less 30,000 people, many terrorists. allies bombed dresden wwii, dropped 4,000 tons bombs killed 25,000 people two days. nazis liquidated warsaw ghetto, killed 250,000 jews 50 75 jewish population warsaw time less time war gone on. israel dropped 15x bombs allies dresden, less dense city, killed roughly number people, many terrorists. suggests clear distinction targeting terrorists. israel wanted treat gaza like nazis treated jews, gaza would flat, would 1 million casualties, likely closer 1.5 million. less 30,000. brazil lula disgraced inverted holocaust attack jews memory. deliberately antisemitic so.",210,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1auu1ay/israel_declares_brazils_lula_persona_non_grata/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1auu1ay/israel_declares_brazils_lula_persona_non_grata/kr6yzkr,34.419951380448,-0.9991,5.3471075307174685

2024-10-21 04:10:16,worldnews,Israel,1g8h9kj,lsyh0hq,Israel gave the White House its demands for ending the war in Lebanon,"Israel gave the U.S. a document last week with its conditions for a diplomatic solution to end the war in Lebanon and allow displaced civilians from both sides of the border to return to their homes, two U.S. officials and two Israeli officials told Axios.

*Why it matters:* The Israeli Prime Minister's Office gave the paper to the White House ahead of President Biden's envoy Amos Hochstein's visit to Beirut on Monday to discuss a diplomatic solution to the conflict, Israeli officials said.

*Behind the scenes:* The U.S. and Israeli officials told Axios Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, who is a confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, sent the document to Hochstein on Thursday.

Israeli officials said the paper came out of discussions Dermer had with the Israeli Ministry of Defense and the Israel Defense Forces about the principles Israel demands be part of any diplomatic solution to end the war with Hezbollah.

One Israeli demand is that the IDF be allowed to engage in ""active enforcement"" to make sure Hezbollah doesn't rearm and rebuild its military infrastructure in the areas of southern Lebanon that are close to the border, an Israeli official said.
The official added that Israel also demands its air force have freedom of operation in Lebanese air space.

*Friction point:* These two demands contradict UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which states that the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) enforce a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.

""We are talking about 1701 with increased enforcement. Our main message is that if the Lebanese army and UNIFIL do more, the IDF will do less and the other way around"", the Israeli official told me.

A U.S. official said it is highly unlikely Lebanon and the international community would agree to these conditions, which would dramatically undermine Lebanon's sovereignty.
The White House and the Israeli embassy in Washington declined to comment.

*Driving the news:* Hochstein is expected to arrive in Beirut on Monday and meet with acting prime minister Najib Mikati, speaker of parliament Nabih Berri and other Lebanese officials and discuss the Israeli demands.

Berri told Al-Arabiya on Sunday that Hochstein's visit is ""the last chance before the U.S. elections to reach a solution"" to the war in Lebanon.
He stressed there is consensus in Lebanon about UN Resolution 1701 and made clear he refuses to amend it in any way, which is effectively what Israel is demanding.

*Between the lines:* Hochstein is pushing for a wide-ranging deployment of the Lebanese armed forces in southern Lebanon as part of every diplomatic solution that ends the war in Lebanon, U.S. and Israeli officials say.

In recent years, the Lebanese army had very limited forces in the area, which was mostly controlled by Hezbollah.

Hochstein wants to have at least 8,000 Lebanese troops deployed in southern Lebanon, the officials said.
The U.S. envoy also wants to upgrade UNIFIL's mandate so it would be able to help the Lebanese army prevent armed individuals or groups who are not under the control of the Lebanese government from being deployed near the border with Israel.

U.S. officials admit that since the 2006 war, UNIFIL barely enforced resolution 1701 and didn't prevent Hezbollah from building wide-ranging military infrastructure in southern Lebanon in violation of the resolution.

*State of play:* On Sunday night ahead of Hochstein's visit, the Israeli Air Force conducted airstrikes across Lebanon against dozens of targets affiliated with Hezbollah's bank, including a building in Beirut, the IDF said.

A senior Israeli intelligence official said in a briefing with reporters that the bank operated independently of the Lebanese financial system and was not under the supervision of the government or the central bank.
According to the Israeli intelligence official, the Hezbollah bank received hundreds of millions of dollars from Iran annually and played a key role in funding the group's operations.","israel gave

2024-04-05 19:35:46,worldnews,Israel,1bwqvg7,ky7v215,"Hamas rejects Israel's latest hostage deal proposal, Israel threatens to withdraw from Cairo summit","Hamas rejected [Israel's latest proposal](https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-794951) to cease fighting and release hostages, according to a Friday CNN report.

According to an unnamed diplomat cited by CNN, “They refused and asserted it doesn’t include any reply to their asks.”

According to the diplomat, Hamas believed the “Israeli proposal includes [nothing new](https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-793703), so they see no need to change their proposal,” the official added.

  
Negotiations were supposed to lead to a lasting ceasefire, per the [UN Security Resolution passed last month](https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-793653), and mediators from Egypt, Qatar, and the US have worked to try and broach a deal since the conflict broke out in October.

Negotiators were hoping to achieve a six-week ceasefire and a three-phase framework to secure the release of sick, elderly, and wounded hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners and increased humanitarian aid.

  
Hamas demanded that there be unrestricted return of Gazans to the north and that IDF troops would withdraw.

  
CIA Director William Burns, Mossad Director David Barnea, and Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) Director Ronen Bar were expected to meet in Egypt this weekend to continue ceasefire talks.

However, the latest rejection by Hamas has led Israeli officials to publically wonder whether there is any point in continuing negotiations, according to a report by public broadcaster KAN11.

The trio met last month in Doha for talks with mediators, but no clear breakthrough was reached.

Israel is reportedly pushing both Egypt and Qatar to put pressure on Hamas, with threats to pull out of the Cairo negotiations fully.

Israel has been under increased pressure to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza since the start of the war.

Still, pressure increased last week after the killing of seven foreign aid workers led to the withdrawal of the aid company's services.

  
The pressure led to Israel reopening the Erez crossing for the first time since it was destroyed on October 7, as well as opening up the port in Ashdod to aid deliveries. Kerem Shalom will also be opened.

The cabinet also approved on Friday evening the arrival of Jordanian army trucks carrying humanitarian aid to come through Israeli territory directly to the Gaza Strip.

  
The plan is for the trucks to enter through the Allenby crossing in a convoy to Kerem Shalom, where they will be inspected - and from there, they will continue on to Gaza.","hamas rejected  israel s latest proposal   to cease fighting and release hostages, according to a friday cnn report.  according to an unnamed diplomat cited by cnn,  they refused and asserted it doesn t include any reply to their asks.   according to the diplomat, hamas believed the  israeli proposal includes  nothing new   so they see no need to change their proposal,  the official added.     negotiations were supposed to lead to a lasting ceasefire, per the  un security resolution passed last month   and mediators from egypt, qatar, and the us have worked to try and broach a deal since the conflict broke out in october.  negotiators were hoping to achieve a six week ceasefire and a three phase framework to secure the release of sick, elderly, and wounded hostages in exchange for the release of palestinian prisoners and increased humanitarian aid.     hamas demanded that there be unrestricted return of gazans to the north and that idf troops would withdraw.     cia director william burns, mossad director david barnea, and shin bet  israel security agency  director ronen bar were expected to meet in egypt this weekend to continue ceasefire talks.  however, the latest rejection by hamas has led israeli officials to publically wonder whether there is any point in continuing negotiations, according to a report by public broadcaster kan11.  the trio met last month in doha for talks with mediators, but no clear breakthrough was reached.  israel is reportedly pushing both egypt and qatar to put pressure on hamas, with threats to pull out of the cairo negotiations fully.  israel has been under increased pressure to allow more humanitarian aid into gaza since the start of the war.  still, pressure increased last week after the killing of seven foreign aid workers led to the withdrawal of the aid company s services.     the pressure led to israel reopening the erez crossing for the first time since it was destroyed on october 7, as well as opening up the port in ashdod to aid deliveries. kerem shalom will also be opened.  the cabinet also approved on friday evening the arrival of jordanian army trucks carrying humanitarian aid to come through israeli territory directly to the gaza strip.     the plan is for the trucks to enter through the allenby crossing in a convoy to kerem shalom, where they will be inspected   and from there, they will continue on to gaza.","hamas rejected israel latest proposal cease fighting release hostages, according friday cnn report. according unnamed diplomat cited cnn, refused asserted include reply asks. according diplomat, hamas believed israeli proposal includes nothing new see need change proposal, official added. negotiations supposed lead lasting ceasefire, per un security resolution passed last month mediators egypt, qatar, us worked try broach deal since conflict broke october. negotiators hoping achieve six week ceasefire three phase framework secure release sick, elderly, wounded hostages exchange release palestinian prisoners increased humanitarian aid. hamas demanded unrestricted return gazans north idf troops would withdraw. cia director william burns, mossad director david barnea, shin bet israel security agency director ronen bar expected meet egypt weekend continue ceasefire talks. however, latest rejection hamas led israeli officials publically wonder whether point continuing negotiations, according report public broadcaster kan11. trio met last month doha talks mediators, clear breakthrough reached. israel reportedly pushing egypt qatar put pressure hamas, threats pull cairo negotiations fully. israel increased pressure allow humanitarian aid gaza since start war. still, pressure increased last week killing seven foreign aid workers led withdrawal aid company services. pressure led israel reopening erez crossing first time since destroyed october 7, well opening port ashdod aid deliveries. kerem shalom also opened. cabinet also approved friday evening arrival jordanian army trucks carrying humanitarian aid come israeli territory directly gaza strip. plan trucks enter allenby crossing convoy kerem shalom, inspected there, continue gaza.",785,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1bwqvg7/hamas_rejects_israels_latest_hostage_deal/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1bwqvg7/hamas_rejects_israels_latest_hostage_deal/ky7v215,52.04341603053435,-0.9831,6.665683717782408

Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on Sunday he had ordered his ministry to start legal proceedings against French President Emmanuel Macron after Paris banned Israeli firms from participating in an upcoming military naval trade show.

Euronaval, organizer of the Nov. 4-7 event in Paris, said in a statement last week that the French government had informed it that Israeli delegations were not allowed to exhibit stands or show equipment, but could attend the trade show. The decision affected seven firms, it said.

How do we go about it? 


As someone who been here on 7.10 in my kibbutz near the fence, I can't look at our relationship with Palestinians the same. It's not about hating some ethnic group, it's just that people I worked with were collecting intel for hamas about our homes and where each family lives and who to target. They were civilians of Gaza.

In middle eastern geopolitics, this is how diplomacy is done. The powers in the region can't back down because that will show weakness, but they're also too proud and ideologically driven to have normal diplomatic ties. This is the alternative. They keep exchanging tit for tats, and adjust the scale and intensity based on the circumstances. 

In this case, after Israel bulldozed Iran's crown proxy in Hezbollah (specifically Nasrallah), Iran felt like they needed to strike back to maintain their credibility to their allies. However, they also don't want to escalate things to a war because that'll end badly for them since they're no match for the American led coalition in the region. So instead, they decided to launch a flashy barrage of empty missles that make a lot of good noise for PR but actually do little damage. 

This way Iran can pretend that it bested Israel while simultaneously signaling that they don't want things to escalate. This isn't new. We've already seen Iran do this when Soleimani was killed and again when Haniyeh was killed. This time doesn't seem any different. 

The key here is that Biden managed to successfully convince Israel to not escalate further, at least on paper. Israel's retaliation is going to be smaller than the barrage of missles that Iran launched, and Iran's response to this will likely be even smaller, and they'll continue launching smaller and smaller retaliatory strikes until they go back to the status quo.

Longbottom emphasized that Israel's actions are seen as self-defense, unlike the aggressive actions of Russia and Belarus.

Rahm Emanuel, the US Ambassador to Japan, echoed similar sentiments, expressing that he did not want to support what he viewed as the politicization of the event by excluding Israel.

Emanuel will instead attend a separate event in Tokyo.

Nagasaki's mayor, Shiro Suzuki, explained that the decision not to invite Israel was based on security concerns and the desire to maintain a peaceful and somber atmosphere during the ceremony.

Despite these explanations, the decision has been criticized by various quarters, including the Israeli ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, who attended the Hiroshima peace ceremony earlier this week.

The exclusion of Israel has led to a broader diplomatic fallout, with other Western countries such as Australia, Italy, Canada, and the European Union also indicating lower-level representation at the Nagasaki ceremony.

2024-10-09 02:25:48,worldnews,Israel,1fzh7qn,lr1a2iw,Pierre Poilievre says Israel preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons would be a ‘gift’ to humanity,"From the article:

OTTAWA — Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says it would be a “gift” for Israel to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, a statement he made when asked about American opposition to an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear sites.

Outside the House of Commons on Tuesday, Poilievre sidestepped a question about whether an Israeli strike against nuclear facilities in Iran could lead to a direct war between the adversaries. U.S. President Joe Biden, who like Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has urged restraint to prevent the conflict from intensifying further, [told reporters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/biden-says-he-does-not-support-attack-irans-nuclear-sites-2024-10-02/) last week that he does not support an attack on Iran’s nuclear sites. 

Poilievre, however, said Tuesday it would be “the most dangerous and irresponsible thing in the world” to allow Iran — an authoritarian regime that views Israel as illegitimate — to use those facilities to acquire nuclear weapons. 

“If Israel were to stop that genocidal, theocratic, unstable government from acquiring nuclear weapons, it would be a gift by the Jewish state to humanity,” the Conservative leader said. 

Poilievre made the statement moments after he was reprimanded in the House of Commons for claiming, one day earlier, that Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly was pandering to supporters of Hamas, the group Canada deems a terrorist entity that launched the assaults on Oct. 7, 2023 in which more than 1,200 people in Israel were killed and roughly 250 taken hostage. 

On Monday, Poilievre told a Jewish memorial event that Israel should have the right to “proactively” strike Iranian nuclear sites in order to defend itself.","from the article   ottawa   conservative leader pierre poilievre says it would be a  gift  for israel to prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons, a statement he made when asked about american opposition to an israeli attack on iranian nuclear sites.  outside the house of commons on tuesday, poilievre sidestepped a question about whether an israeli strike against nuclear facilities in iran could lead to a direct war between the adversaries. u.s. president joe biden, who like prime minister justin trudeau has urged restraint to prevent the conflict from intensifying further,  told reporters   last week that he does not support an attack on iran s nuclear sites.   poilievre, however, said tuesday it would be  the most dangerous and irresponsible thing in the world  to allow iran   an authoritarian regime that views israel as illegitimate   to use those facilities to acquire nuclear weapons.    if israel were to stop that genocidal, theocratic, unstable government from acquiring nuclear weapons, it would be a gift by the jewish state to humanity,  the conservative leader said.   poilievre made the statement moments after he was reprimanded in the house of commons for claiming, one day earlier, that foreign affairs minister m lanie joly was pandering to supporters of hamas, the group canada deems a terrorist entity that launched the assaults on oct. 7, 2023 in which more than 1,200 people in israel were killed and roughly 250 taken hostage.   on monday, poilievre told a jewish memorial event that israel should have the right to  proactively  strike iranian nuclear sites in order to defend itself.","article ottawa conservative leader pierre poilievre says would gift israel prevent iran developing nuclear weapons, statement made asked american opposition israeli attack iranian nuclear sites. outside house commons tuesday, poilievre sidestepped question whether israeli strike nuclear facilities iran could lead direct war adversaries. u.s. president joe biden, like prime minister justin trudeau urged restraint prevent conflict intensifying further, told reporters last week support attack iran nuclear sites. poilievre, however, said tuesday would dangerous irresponsible thing world allow iran authoritarian regime views israel illegitimate use facilities acquire nuclear weapons. israel stop genocidal, theocratic, unstable government acquiring nuclear weapons, would gift jewish state humanity, conservative leader said. poilievre made statement moments reprimanded house commons claiming, one day earlier, foreign affairs minister lanie joly pandering supporters hamas, group canada deems terrorist entity launched assaults oct. 7, 2023 1,200 people israel killed roughly 250 taken hostage. monday, poilievre told jewish memorial event israel right proactively strike iranian nuclear sites order defend itself.",42,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1fzh7qn/pierre_poilievre_says_israel_preventing_iran_from/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1fzh7qn/pierre_poilievre_says_israel_preventing_iran_from/lr1a2iw,56.4019305019305,-0.9847,3.7376696182833684

A small portion of land was taken without consultation with the locals and without any agreement with them, but they still had a majority of their land to themselves. And not only that but the newly formed state of Israel seemed open to having discussions with their neighbours and maybe finding a peaceful solution. But no, instead their neighbors decided violence would be their only answer to the situation, and in doing so they lost more land and power all while thousands of people lost their lives, mostly their own. Would they learn? Only a few of them, Jordan and Egypt got smart about it and made peace, as well as some other Muslim states further away. But Palestine and Lebanon just decided their one solution, a failing solution, would be the only idea they entertained and in doing so continued to lose more and more land and power. And as a result Israel got comfortable with what they had taken and people began the lives of several generations on these lands making it harder and harder to leave them. So as a result Israel became less lenient with what they were willing to give back to these neighbouring states.

Now they have next to nothing and they are still using a strategy that has never won them an inch of land back. Protests like this and the violence from the people fighting in that area will never bring any positive results for the Palestinians. Peaceful negotiations are the only way. And unfortunately because of their past actions any chance to take back their original lands will take at least as long as it did to lose them all, and likely much longer.

I just don't get why they can't come to the table with Israel and negotiate peacefully.

It would have made no sense whatsoever for UNWRA operations within Gaza to be anything else than what they are : an accessory to Hamas' policies, and to employ Hamas sympathisers and members only. No dictatorship would have it any other way. No genocidal zealot will ever oustsource education to  a neutral third party.

That this is even disputed, that some people would lend a sympathetic ear to UNWRA' s denials is only further demonstration of how fucked up the situation is, when suspension of belief, denial of the most obvious reality become the norm.

The concept of [UNWRA neutrality ](https://www.unrwa.org/neutrality) in a place like Gaza (their pillars are neutrality , impartiality and independence!) is an insult to intelligence. The denials of their hierarchy only serves to demonstrate that, far from being neutral they're in cahoots with that abhorrent criminal regime. They should be prosecuted.

2023-11-26 23:33:56,worldnews,Palestine,184nbsv,kawjgo3,Human Rights Watch says rocket misfire likely cause of deadly Gaza hospital blast,"Hmm.... which side do we believe? HRW which explicitly says: 

>It said the findings of its investigation into the explosion were based on a review of photos and videos, satellite imagery and interviews with witnesses and experts.


Or Hamas?

>Senior Hamas official Basem Naim told Reuters all indications pointed to Israel's responsibility, adding that the HRW report was biased towards Israel and was not ""decisive"".

>""HRW hasn't come up with any evidence to support their findings nor eyewitness testimonies nor opinion of independent military exports,"" he said, 

I dug out the HRW report itself, here's some choice quotes:

>The Ministry of Health in Gaza reported that 471 people were killed and 342 injured. Human Rights Watch was unable to corroborate the count, which is significantly higher than other estimates, displays an unusually high killed-to-injured ratio, and appears out of proportion with the damage visible on site.

.

>Gaza authorities appear to be in possession of remnants that would help make a conclusive determination of the munition that exploded at al-Ahli hospital. A photo taken the evening of the explosion shows employees of the Explosive Ordnance Department, a specialized Gaza police unit, working on the crater. A witness who was at the hospital on the evening of the explosion told Human Rights Watch that employees of “the Ministry of Interior took all the shrapnel that was on the site.”

>A Hamas official said the remnants would “soon be shown to the world.” More than a month after the events, this has not happened. Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas leader and deputy minister in the Hamas-led Gaza governing authority, told the media on October 22 that “the missile has dissolved like salt in the water.… It’s vaporized. Nothing is left.” Human Rights Watched noted that substantial portions of munitions typically survive a detonation, even if parts of munitions are designed to break apart and may be made unrecognizable by thermal damage.

Seems to be a rather detailed report, better than I was expecting from HRW at this point

And it was all because organizations like HRW and mainstream media outlets reported whatever Hamas told them.

>The evidence emerged in new research from ESET, a cybersecurity company based in Slovakia. Analysts at the firm detected five campaigns spreading trojanized apps to Android users. The attacks focus on user data espionage in Palestine and Egypt.

>The campaigns deploy multistage Android spyware, which ESET calls “AridSpy.”

>To distribute the spyware, the hackers used dedicated websites that impersonate real apps. In Palestine, they primarily harnessed a malicious Palestinian Civil Registry app.

>“In order to gain initial access to the device, the threat actors try to convince their potential victim to install a fake, but functional, app,” said Lukáš Štefanko, the ESET researcher who discovered AridSpy.

>“Once the target clicks the site’s download button, myScript.js, hosted on the same server, is executed to generate the correct download path for the malicious file.”

>ESET attributed the campaigns — with “medium confidence” — to the notorious Arid Viper APT group.

>**Who is Arid Viper?**

>Arid Viper is also known as APT-C-23, Desert Falcons, or Two-tailed Scorpion. Active since at least 2013, the cyberespionage group is notorious for targeting countries in the Middle East. It’s also known for deploying a vast arsenal of malware for Android, iOS, and Windows platforms.

>Cybersecurity vendors have previously linked the group to Hamas. It primarily targets entities in Israel and Palestine, but its reach extends beyond these borders. Analysts have said this hints at a broader geopolitical agenda.

>ESET’s new research, however, makes no accusations of political connections. The company has instead focused on the cyberespionage techniques.

2024-06-07 15:47:05,worldnews,Palestine,1dadzav,l7jl6or,Israel suggests Labour are ‘rewarding terrorists’ with Palestine manifesto vow,"Israel has reacted with anger to Labour’s manifesto pledge to recognise a Palestinian state before the end of any peace negotiations, suggesting Sir Keir Starmer wants to “reward terrorists”.

A leak of the manifesto revealed by **i** showed Labour would go further than the current UK Government, by supporting statehood for Palestinians “as part of a peace process” rather than after it has concluded.

The Labour leader insisted on Friday that this would not happen while Hamas retained control in Gaza as Israel being “safe and secure” would be a precondition to the move.

But Israeli government spokesman David Mencer told **i**: “Countries embarking on this path should ask themselves this simple question: does their action support peace-makers or does it reward terrorists?

“Eight months to the day since the horrors of 7 October and the Palestinian Authority (PA) have yet to find the time to condemn Hamas.

“All of us here in Israel are left with no other conclusion that the PA thinks what Hamas did on that black day was a good idea.”

As **i** revealed on Thursday, the Labour manifesto – which is being finalised at a meeting in central London – would support Palestinian statehood as part of the Middle East peace process.

The party still backs international efforts to pursue a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians.

During a campaign visit in Brent Cross on Friday, Starmer did not deny that the manifesto pledge would involve recognition during peace negotiations.

He was asked by reporters to categorically rule out Labour recognising Palestine while Hamas retains some control in [Gaza](https://inews.co.uk/topic/gaza?ico=in-line_link), and to explain at what stage in a peace process the party would recognise a state.

The Labour leader said: “Thank you for raising that because it’s very important that I set out for what our position is, which is to recognise Palestine as part of the process to a two-state solution, but part of the process.

“So that means it’s got to be at the right time in the process because we need a viable Palestinian state alongside a safe and secure Israel, to your point.

“We don’t have either of those at the moment. And therefore it’s got to be at the point in the process where we can see both of those outcomes.

“It is important for me to say that recognising Palestine… is not the gift of Israel or anyone else. It is a right but it has to be in the process so that both things happen, a viable Palestinian state and a safe and secure Israel.

“Neither of those things are the position at the moment.”

Inclusion of the pledge in the manifesto is an apparent attempt to stave off Labour losing votes on the left, after Starmer was criticised for being too slow to back an immediate ceasefire in Gaza – which triggered the resignations of Labour councillors.

There were signs that Starmer’s earlier stance had cost Labour some votes in the local and mayoral elections in May.

Following the announcement by Ireland, Spain and Norway that they plan to recognise a state of Palestine, Labour said if elected into government it would begin discussions “in earnest” with “like-minded countries”.

The United States needs its European allies to face down the threat of Russia and China, the deputy secretary general of Nato has told The Telegraph.

There are fears Donald Trump could halt military support for Ukraine if he wins November’s presidential election, or even withdraw Washington’s security guarantee for Europe entirely.

But Mircea Geoană said that with the West locked in an era of “great power competition” with autocratic countries such as Russia, its ally China, North Korea and Iran, the transatlantic alliance was more important than ever.

“As much Europe needs America, America, I think needs all its allies,” he told The Telegraph.

“The strategic reality is that China is a formidable challenger and that Russia and China and all the others together will create massive attempts to disrupt American power.”

**‘Epic struggle’**

He added: “There is an intense aggressive interest from these countries to basically challenge the world order which was introduced after the end of the Second World War.

“In this epic struggle America will need not only its own strength, but also all the allies in the Alliance.”

Mr Trump has warned he would let Russia do “whatever they hell they want” to any Nato member who does not meet its alliance defence spending target of 2 per cent of its economic output.

He was widely criticised for undermining the principle that an attack on one member is one on all the members of the Alliance.

“We worked for four years with president Trump in the White House. The beginning was quite tumultuous,” Mr Geoană said of a period when Mr Trump branded Nato “obsolete”.

But he said that Mr Trump had been “quite positive” about Nato in his final State of the Union address. He added that the race with Joe Biden was “way too close to call”.

Mr Geoană said: “I think strategic logic will prevail and we are confident that America will continue as they’ve done for the last 75 years and continue to be a key player.”

The United States remains the single largest donor of weapons and aid to Ukraine but some believe Europe is not doing enough to help Ukraine.

>Livne warned that the decision would “harm Poland”. But Sikorski today responded by labelling the remarks “patronising” and saying that it is “the Polish government, not foreign ambassadors, which will decide what is good for Poland”.


>On Friday, Poland was among the majority of 143 countries to vote in favour of supporting Palestine’s bid to become a full member of the UN.

>Only nine countries opposed the motion: the United States, Argentina, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea and Israel itself. A further 25 – including Canada, Germany, Italy, Ukraine and the United Kingdom – abstained.

>Following the vote, Livne took to X to criticise Poland’s decision. He warned that it set a “dangerous precedent of rewarding the aggressor”, that it “continued the 1988 Soviet-led anti-West decision of recognising [a] ‘Palestinian state'”, that it “rewarded Iran and Hamas”, and that it was a “complete violation of the UN charter”.

>“This is a wrong and harmful decision for security, stability, and for Poland,” added the ambassador.


>In an interview on Tuesday morning with Polskie Radio, Sikorski noted that an “ambassador has the right to express the views or interests of his country”. He added, however, that “the Polish government will decide what is good for Poland, not foreign ambassadors”.

>“I think that the ambassador needs to get to know us better and realise that we, as Poles, react badly to a patronising tone,” added the minister.

>He went on to clarify that Poland’s decision at the UN “was not a vote against Israel, it was a vote in favour of a two-state solution in line with the Polish policy of recognising Palestinian statehood that we have been pursuing for more than three decades”.

>Today, Sikorski’s ministry also published posts on social media wishing Israel “peace and prosperity” on the occasion of its independence day.


>Recent weeks have seen heightened tensions between Poland and Israel, in particular following the death of a Polish aid worker, Damian Soból, during the Israeli strike on a World Central Kitchen convoy in Gaza.

>Livne’s initial refusal to apologise for the incident – and his claims that some Polish politicians were stoking antisemitism by suggesting Israel deliberately attacked the convoy – caused anger in Poland. President Andrzej Duda and Prime Minister Donald Tusk were among those to criticise him.

>Subsequently, Livne was summoned to the Polish foreign ministry, where he delivered an apology."," poland s foreign minister, rados aw sikorski, has hit back at israeli ambassador yacov livne for

Understand there are countries such as Russia that consider us foreign adversaries and have been known to manipulate social media content to polarize people especially when it comes to LGBT issues, they especially have roots in conservative social media, where they have the capability to influence people on a mass scale.

It's a national security issue and more should be done to protect the vulnerable LGBT community.

https://www.stalbertgazette.com/local-news/did-reddit-year-end-recaps-expose-russian-interference-in-alberta-8223476

There are clear goals being perpetuated by information warfare campaigns. Especially by Russia, whose information warfare campaigns are wreaking havoc on our society. Some of the obvious goals they have are:

• Balkanize their foreign adversaries. This is evident in the UK leaving the EU, Texas with the US, and Alberta with Canada. This is what Danielle Smith is trying to tap into.

• Have populist politicians support policies that cause chaos and issues in our society. Populist politicians are tapping into these information warfare campaigns to appeal to people whose only access to information about the outside world around them is through social media, where the information warfare is taking place.

• Cause distrust and havoc, by creating specialized propaganda to different segments of the population spread through social media. By polarizing debates through propaganda spread to the masses, Russia has effectively used information warfare to deliver targeted disinformation and appeal to specific demographics. Causing havoc in the LBGT and other minority communities.

• Russia has effectively infiltrated the religious right in America and Canada and empowered them, among many corrupt leaders worldwide through its information warfare.

I can cite my sources if needed.

Putin literally bombed his own people to lock down his power and control. Why should we trust that he is not carrying out horrible atrocities like using information warfare on Canadian citizens to terrorize the LGBT community? He doesn't seem to have any moral qualms with anything and corruption is part of his shtick. He used a nerve agent to publicly poison a turned intelligence asset at a important time in history to signify to his intelligence assets what can be done to them, but in reality, he is just a weak man, who is bitter about the break up of the empire he devoted his life to.

It you want to know more, there is a great documentary series on Netflix about the history that has led to this moment in time. Turning Point - The Bomb and the Cold War on Netflix. Not as much about the information warfare, that I have gleamed through other sources, but it does slightly touch on that.","something is happening all right. understand there are countries such as russia that consider us foreign adversaries and have been known to manipulate social media content to polarize people especially when it comes to lgbt issues, they especially have roots in conservative social media, where they have the capability to influence people on a mass scale.    it s a national security issue and more should be done to protect the vulnerable lgbt community.        there are clear goals being perpetuated by information warfare campaigns. especially by russia, whose information warfare campaigns are wreaking havoc on our society. some of the obvious goals they have are       balkanize their foreign adversaries. this is evident in the uk leaving the eu, texas with the us, and alberta with canada. this is what danielle smith is trying to tap into.      have populist politicians support policies that cause chaos and issues in our society. populist politicians are tapping into these information warfare campaigns to appeal to people whose only access to information about the outside world around them is through social media, where the information warfare is taking place.      cause distrust and havoc, by creating specialized propaganda to different segments of the population spread through social media. by polarizing debates through propaganda spread to the masses, russia has effectively used information warfare to deliver targeted disinformation and appeal to specific demographics. causing havoc in the lbgt and other minority communities.      russia has effectively infiltrated the religious right in america and canada and empowered them, among many corrupt leaders worldwide through its information warfare.    i can cite my sources if needed.    putin literally bombed his own people to lock down his power and control. why should we trust that he is not carrying out horrible atrocities like using information warfare on canadian citizens to terrorize the lgbt community? he doesn t seem to have any moral qualms with anything and corruption is part of his shtick. he used a nerve agent to publicly poison a turned intelligence asset at a important time in history to signify to his intelligence assets what can be done to them, but in reality, he is just a weak man, who is bitter about the break up of the empire he devoted his life to.    it you want to know more, there is a great documentary series on netflix about the history that has led to this moment in time. turning point   the bomb and the cold war on netflix. not as much about the information warfare, that i have gleamed through other sources, but it does slightly touch on that.","something happening right. understand countries russia consider us foreign adversaries known manipulate social media content polarize people especially comes lgbt issues, especially roots conservative social media, capability influence people mass scale. national security issue done protect vulnerable lgbt community. clear goals perpetuated information warfare campaigns. especially russia, whose information warfare campaigns wreaking havoc society. obvious goals balkanize foreign adversaries. evident uk leaving eu, texas us, alberta canada. danielle smith trying tap into. populist politicians support policies cause chaos issues society. populist politicians tapping information warfare campaigns appeal people whose access information outside world around social media, information warfare taking place. cause distrust havoc, creating specialized propaganda different segments population spread social media. polarizing debates propaganda spread masses, russia effectively used information warfare deliver targeted disinformation appeal specific demographics. causing havoc lbgt minority communities. russia effectively infiltrated religious right america canada empowered them, among many corrupt leaders worldwide information warfare. cite sources needed. putin literally bombed people lock power control. trust carrying horrible atrocities like using information warfare canadian citizens terrorize lgbt community? seem moral qualms anything corruption part shtick. used nerve agent publicly poison turned intelligence asset important time history signify intelligence assets done them, reality, weak man, bitter break empire devoted life to. want know more, great documentary series netflix history led moment time. turning point bomb cold war netflix. much information warfare, gleamed sources, slightly touch that.",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1c22coe/un_speaks_of_existential_threat_to_the_people_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1c22coe/un_speaks_of_existential_threat_to_the_people_of/kz9fzjk,47.705128205128204,-0.6833,1.3862943611198906

For those unaware; this is how the global macro economy has crushed countless African nations and agrarian based economies, and is also a means of crushing domestic farmers and business in developed nations.

What occurs is you have multi national corporations like Monsanto receiving substantial subsidies from governments like the USA or Canada. The subsidy is an export subsidy, which then allows the corporation to sell food goods below world market price.

The corporation then floods a state; in this case Poland; with goods that the micro economy simply cannot compete with. As the farmers of the target state fail,  enter Monsanto, who then purchases the capacity and land at a discount rate.

Hamas knew it would be a massive boost to Israel’s morale to see Noa freed (which it did) so they’d rather torpedo an extra day of ceasefire rather than release her in negotiations.

If the article is correct, I don’t understand why Hamas insisted on listing Carmel Gat as a solider. She was 39 years old, an Occupational Therapist and just returned from a yoga retreat in India. She was initially kept in an apartment with 2 children, a preteen and teenager, who found out after the hostage release that both their parents were murdered. Carmel helped those traumatized kids cope in captivity with yoga. The kids later told their uncle that Hamas took them to ‘go to the bathroom’ and never informed Carmel of their release. 

I’m heartbroken for Carmel. Logistics wise, they were already releasing 2 children in the same location as her. Instead she was murdered in that terrible pass through tunnel that they couldn’t stand up in, with no ventilation, no toilets and only 2 people could lay down in the width.","noa and shiri bibas with her babies were the faces of the oct 7 massacre in the early days. i don t think hamas ever would have released noa. they were having too much fun using her as constant propaganda in the psychological war on israel. hamas knew it would be a massive boost to israel s morale to see noa freed  which it did  so they d rather torpedo an extra day of ceasefire rather than release her in negotiations.    if the article is correct, i don t understand why hamas insisted on listing carmel gat as a solider. she was 39 years old, an occupational therapist and just returned from a yoga retreat in india. she was initially kept in an apartment with 2 children, a preteen and teenager, who found out after the hostage release that both their parents were murdered. carmel helped those traumatized kids cope in captivity with yoga. the kids later told their uncle that hamas took them to  go to the bathroom  and never informed carmel of their release.     i m heartbroken for carmel. logistics wise, they were already releasing 2 children in the same location as her. instead she was murdered in that terrible pass through tunnel that they couldn t stand up in, with no ventilation, no toilets and only 2 people could lay down in the width.","noa shiri bibas babies faces oct 7 massacre early days. think hamas ever would released noa. much fun using constant propaganda psychological war israel. hamas knew would massive boost israel morale see noa freed rather torpedo extra day ceasefire rather release negotiations. article correct, understand hamas insisted listing carmel gat solider. 39 years old, occupational therapist returned yoga retreat india. initially kept apartment 2 children, preteen teenager, found hostage release parents murdered. carmel helped traumatized kids cope captivity yoga. kids later told uncle hamas took go bathroom never informed carmel release. heartbroken carmel. logistics wise, already releasing 2 children location her. instead murdered terrible pass tunnel stand in, ventilation, toilets 2 people could lay width.",33,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1flh4y6/report_nov_truce_collapsed_because_hamas_falsely/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1flh4y6/report_nov_truce_collapsed_because_hamas_falsely/lo5pnj1,39.18098384728341,-0.9262,3.4965075614664802

>The document, seen by Reuters, refers to Russia's actions as a ""war"" – a term Moscow rejects – and calls for restoring Ukraine's control over key facilities and regions.

>It urges Moscow to cease military actions and return the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and Azov Sea ports to Ukrainian control.

>The draft condemns the threat of nuclear weapon use in the conflict and decries attacks on commercial ships and civilian port infrastructure. It demands the return of all Ukrainian children and civilians unlawfully taken to Russia.

>White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan highlighted Qatar's mediation in returning over 30 Ukrainian children from Russia. Kyiv claims around 20,000 children have been taken to Russia or Russian-occupied territories without consent, a claim Moscow denies, asserting it has protected vulnerable children.

>The official declaration is set to be issued at the conclusion of the summit, held in the Swiss resort of Bürgenstock, which aims to initiate a peace process for Ukraine with over 100 world leaders and organizations in attendance.

>Key figures such as U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and French President Emmanuel Macron are among those present. Poland is represented by the country’s president Andrzej Duda.

No? That was never the purpose of the UN. It exists so that states have a viable alternative to war as a means of conflict resolution. *A UN ambassador should know this!* The Korean War, the Suez Crisis, the Invasion of Kuwait are all examples of the UN at full capacity. The only reason the UN has dropped the ball so many times is because the Security Council is treated as a dick measuring contest by the Permanent 5.

Just look at Ukraine, under the UN charter every member state is - *theoretically* \- obligated to commit forces to aid in their defensive war. However, the General Assembly can only request that the Security Council invoke the collective defense clause. That just isn't possible 99% of the time because one of the P5 always vetoes it. In the case of the Gulf War, the Soviets joined France, the United Kingdom, and the United States in approving the collective defense request. China abstained.

Whenever the P5 put their own disagreements aside, the UN functions. There are solutions to that, but to say the UN has failed when our planet hasn't been reduced to large swathes radioactive wasteland is complete bullshit.","  the un was founded on the ashes of the holocaust to prevent atrocities,    erdan   emphasized.  it is looked at as the bastion of civilization, a moral compass that all nations should follow. sadly, the un has failed spectacularly to carry out its mandate.     no? that was never the purpose of the un. it exists so that states have a viable alternative to war as a means of conflict resolution.  a un ambassador should know this!  the korean war, the suez crisis, the invasion of kuwait are all examples of the un at full capacity. the only reason the un has dropped the ball so many times is because the security council is treated as a dick measuring contest by the permanent 5.    just look at ukraine, under the un charter every member state is    theoretically     obligated to commit forces to aid in their defensive war. however, the general assembly can only request that the security council invoke the collective defense clause. that just isn t possible 99  of the time because one of the p5 always vetoes it. in the case of the gulf war, the soviets joined france, the united kingdom, and the united states in approving the collective defense request. china abstained.    whenever the p5 put their own disagreements aside, the un functions. there are solutions to that, but to say the un has failed when our planet hasn t been reduced to large swathes radioactive wasteland is complete bullshit.","un founded ashes holocaust prevent atrocities, erdan emphasized. looked bastion civilization, moral compass nations follow. sadly, un failed spectacularly carry mandate. no? never purpose un. exists states viable alternative war means conflict resolution. un ambassador know this! korean war, suez crisis, invasion kuwait examples un full capacity. reason un dropped ball many times security council treated dick measuring contest permanent 5. look ukraine, un charter every member state theoretically obligated commit forces aid defensive war. however, general assembly request security council invoke collective defense clause. possible 99 time one p5 always vetoes it. case gulf war, soviets joined france, united kingdom, united states approving collective defense request. china abstained. whenever p5 put disagreements aside, un functions. solutions that, say un failed planet reduced large swathes radioactive wasteland complete bullshit.",18,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/18cvr4z/the_un_has_failed_its_head_needs_to_resign/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/18cvr4z/the_un_has_failed_its_head_needs_to_resign/kcegbvh,39.5051652892562,-0.9694,2.8903717578961645

The Palestinian Authority has a GDP the size of a small town. Its resources are spread to the breaking point just managing ongoing West Bank displacements. They have no experience in counterinsurgency, and no operational capacity for aid delivery.

At best, they could deliver moral support to an Israeli occupation and reconstruction effort, if Israel was going to commit to funding and staffing it.

But even that moral support would be very difficult to provide. Hamas was able to gain power in Gaza because the people lost hope for any other solution to their problems. There doesn't seem to be an understanding in Israel that the Oslo accords were already very optimistic about how little Palestine could survive on, and that it's simply not possible to create a Palestinian state with less. Quite the opposite, the West Bank is still shrinking, and it seems as though the Palestinian Archipelago of more than 100 disconnected West Bank enclaves will continue to shrink and remain Bantustans indefinitely.

Right now, they cannot even promise Gaza that they'll be economically integrated as a Bantustan, let alone become a stable state. Just bringing Gaza up to being only as bad as the Palestinian West Bank would take decades of work with an annual budget twice the PA's entire GDP. 

It's not something the PA can achieve. If they try, they'll fail, and lose any credibility they have as moderate voices advocating less extreme forms of resistance. The only real solution to this is to build a Gaza that can be economically integrated with its neighbors, with real opportunities, and a tax base capable of resisting extremist groups.

There are more cases, there's a thread in Indian subreddit that compiled multiple cases of gangrapes & paedophilic rapes in just 24 hours happened in India's Independence day.

Now add the institutional gang rape, brutal torture & murder of the Kolkata doctor & the institution itself trying to cover it up, there's no hope for India.

Another rape happened related to this Kolkata case. This time another medical student got raped as she was protesting for the victim of gangrape in Kolkata 

Yes, India is facing a rape crisis. It became such a common occurrence that people grew desensitized to these types of news. Many rapes reported in regional news don't even make it to national coverage. This has always been the case. However, thanks to social media, international audiences are now becoming aware of it. India deserves to be shamed on the world stage for the government to take action regarding law and order. The Indian government doesn't care about local protests because they eventually die down until the next horrific crime makes the news. But the Indian government does care about its perception abroad. Don't let any extreme Indian nationalist tell you that shaming India for rapes is racism.
