2024-09-10 15:45:08,baking,cake,1fcx3s1,lmgcn8m,My first attempt at a honey cake. ,"Here’s the recipe for the Honey Cake

What I am gonna do is give out the ingredients I used in making the cake including the substitutions for gf/lactose free stuff, but for those that don’t have any dietary restrictions, at the end I’ll include the original recipes I took inspiration from.

**For the biscuit layers:**

* Honey 118g
* Sugar 76g
* Clarified butter 30g
* Vegan butter 30g
* Eggs 100g (two medium sized eggs)
* Gluten free bread flour 300g
* Rice flour 54g
* Baking soda 10g
* Salt 1g

You will need additional flour; I’ll talk about this part in the kneading of the dough.



**For the frosting:**

* Gluten free flour 30g
* Rice flour 15g
* Lactose free milk 240g
* Vegan butter 100g
* Clarified butter 70g
* Greek yogurt 10% fat 250g or 170g of lactose free cream cheese 
* Sugar 130g
* vanilla 
* pinch of salt
* Whipping cream (lactose free) 150g

(Presuming they didn't ask for this combo! If they did, they're just a jerk)

   
Is it possible they were expecting or hoping for a more 'standard' flavored cake? Because while it sounds good, if I'd been presented with it I probably would have been a bit overwhelmed, especially considering matcha, almond, and plum wine can be kind of polarizing for people in my experience. This doesn't make how unappreciative they were feel any better or make it okay (I tend to lean on the side of 'if they put effort in, you should appreciate that, even if it's not your cup of tea') but it might explain their response a bit.

If you want to explore like this and have a group that is excited and enthusiastic about it, maybe you could put together some sort of tea party where the star of the show is a cake you made? It gets people excited to try something new and if they're expecting it they might be more receptive!",378,https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1fgndz3/made_buttercream_flower_cake_for_the_first_time/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1fgndz3/made_buttercream_flower_cake_for_the_first_time/ln5oh6j

You are so close, though. It's literally just an issue of technique. Practice your decorating a bit, that's all (and a bit more frosting). If you struggle with smoothing the frosting or the thickness, some acrylic frosting disks could be a really good idea. Also, personally, I would leave the vanilla bean out of the decorative layer of frosting. I don't find it really aesthetically pleasing, but that's just me.

And yes I'm aware cake isn't mandatory, and I should be grateful regardless, but as a kid-- it messes you up when you see other kids have cake on their birthday.

But three years ago, I had an epiphany: I could choose to be disappointed by having no celebration and cake each year, OR I could bake my own cake! As a baker, I decided to just have fun with it, so that's what I've been doing. 

I know your post isn't meant to be that deep OP, but you made me remember the simple pleasures and joy that comes from baking your own celebration cake ✨☺ 

This year, I'm making my favourite German chocolate cake!

As for the topping, I'd recommend using a little clear gel to achieve a firmer set, like pastry chefs use. There are two types, instant and cook type, choose the one that is appropriate for what you are making.
I tend to use instant unless making jam, a hot pudding or custard without cornstarch/tapioca starch, or using it to fix a too liquid fruit pie filling.

I don't think your cheesecake qualifies as a failure at all.

Now you have an excuse to make another and practice. Oh noooo, then you'll have to eat the improved version! 🍽🥹😳🙃

2024-09-24 17:40:40,baking,cake,1foi9de,loq26rb,The Great British Bake Off Cake,"Here is the recipe for anyone who wants to try and bake it!
Ingredient: 
Chocolate Fudge Cake: 
175g Dark Chocolate (54% Cocoa Solids)
150g Unsalted Butter
3 x Eggs
125ml Sour Cream
50ml Vegetable Oil
2 Tsp Vanilla Extract
150g Caster Sugar
150g Soft Brown Sugar
250g Self-Raising Flour
50g Cocoa Powder
1 ½ Tsp Baking Soda
¼ Tsp Salt
125ml Hot Water
Dark Chocolate Ganache:
 300g Dark Chocolate (54% Cocoa Solids)
450ml Double Cream
25g Unsalted Butter
Decoration:
400g Raspberries
 
1. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas Mark 4. Break the dark chocolate into small pieces and cut your butter into cubes. Then in a large mixing bowl add broken dark chocolate and diced butter. Place the mixing bowl over a pan of simmering water (this is a Bain-Marie). Slowly allow the ingredients to melt and mix until the ingredients have been fully incorporated, then remove the bowl from the pan and allow to cool.
2. In another large mixing bowl, add the eggs, sour cream and vegetable oil. Mix until they have become incorporated.
3. Then add the caster sugar and soften brown sugar into the bowl and mix.
4. Once the chocolate-butter mixture has cooled lightly pour it into the wet ingredients and mix until everything has been incorporated. 
5. Sieve the self-raising flour, cocoa powder, bicarbonate soda, and salt into the wet ingredients and add the hot water at this point. Fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until there are no lumps in the mixture.
6. Divide the mixture into 2 x 20cm Cake Tins.
7. Bake the Chocolate Fudge Cakes for 35-40 minutes. You can tell the cake is baked when a toothpick is placed into the center and no batter sticks to the toothpick. 
8. Once baked leave the Chocolate Fudge Cakes to cool on a wire rack.
9. While the Chocolate Fudge Cakes are cooling, make the Dark Chocolate Ganache.
10. Pour the double cream into a pan and heat until it starts to simmer. Once simmering remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.
11. Break the dark chocolate up into small pieces and large into a mixing bowl. Once the cream has cooled slightly, pour the cream into the bowl (with the chocolate). Mix until all the chocolate has melted and the ingredients have come together. Leave the Dark Chocolate to cool and thicken.
12. Add the butter and mix until all of the butter has been fully incorporated into the ganache. Leave the Dark Chocolate to cool and thicken.
13. Once the Chocolate Fudge Cakes have cooled, place one onto a cake board and then place some of the Dark Chocolate Ganache on top. 
14. Using an off-set spatula spread Dark Chocolate Ganache evenly across the cake.
15. Place another cake layer on top and place more Dark Chocolate Ganache evenly across the cake. Again, using an off-set spatula spread Dark Chocolate Ganache evenly across the cake.
16. Spread Dark Chocolate Ganache around the side of the cake and smoothen the ganache using a bench scraper.
17. Finally add the raspberries on top of the cake and make sure to leave one raspberry off the top of the cake to make it perfectly replicate the Bake Off Cake!

2024-08-22 15:04:32,baking,cake,1eylkcl,ljdzv15,My Bánh bò nướng (Vietnamese Honeycomb Cake) won a ribbon at the state fair!,"Recipe from [Chawj Creations](https://chawjcreations.com/pandan-honeycomb-cake-banh-bo-nuong/). I followed it very closely using metric measurements. I also halved the recipe for a few batches and it still turned out well.

INGREDIENTS

2 cups tapioca flour or starch (265 grams)
1/4 cups rice flour (34 grams)
1 Tbsp double acting baking powder (NOT single acting) (15grams)
1 (14 fl oz) can coconut milk (I use Aroy-D brand) (400ml)
1 1/4 cups sugar (260grams)
1 tsp salt (6grams)
1 tsp pandan extract or more (6grams)
6 eggs (room temp) (300grams)
2 tbsp melted coconut oil (or other neutral oil of your choice) (26grams)
INSTRUCTIONS

1) Preheat the oven to 350’ with the baking pan inside to heat up.

2) In a small pan, add in the coconut milk, sugar, and salt. Heat until the sugar is dissolve but not boiling. You should feel no grittiness on the bottom. Let it cool over ice water if needed for faster preparation. Set aside.

3) In a bowl, measure out the tapioca flour, rice flour, and double acting baking powder. Whisk well. Set aside.

4) In another bowl, crack 6 eggs. With a fork, gently poke the yolks and break it apart along with the whites but do not whisk or create any air bubbles. This will cause too much air pockets in the cake during baking time which cause the cake to deflate once it’s cooled. Then add in the cooled coconut sugar mixture and add in 1 tsp of pandan extract. Add more pandan if it’s too light for you. Mix gently. Then add in the dry ingredients and mix gently. There will be chunks of the starches, but that’s okay. The batter will go over a strainer. You just want to mix the starch well enough into the eggs/coconut sugar mixture just so it’s hydrated (again, don’t create too much air pocket).

5) Then pour the chunky batter over a bowl with a strainer. Use a spatula to break apart any chunky parts. Once it’s been well strained, add in the melted coconut oil. Mix gently. By this time the oven should be preheated and the pan should be nice and hot.

6) Get the pan out of the oven and spray it generously with cooking spray. Pour the batter on and stick it back to the oven. Let it cook for at least 40-45 minutes until the cake is cooked in the middle. I cooked mine for 45 minutes. Then turn off the oven heat, open the oven door slightly and let the cake rest inside for 20 minutes.

7) After 20 minutes of resting, take the cake out, flip it over on a board and cut. You can cool it longer if it’s too hot to handle. Cut into your desire size and enjoy!

Especially when you're making a cake that will be eaten in a couple days. As you're layering up, brush some simple syrup onto the sponge before spreading on whatever filling you're putting between layers. It keeps the cake from drying out before you're able to cut into it during whatever event you're creating it for.

The syrup also gives you an opportunity to impart some extra flavor. My SIL requested a tropical -themed cake with funfetti sponge, and I created some pineapple filling but then also included some coconut flavoring in with the cake soak to kind of make a nice pina colada cake. :)",21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1awiuzw/how_do_i_make_a_chocolate_cake_this_dense_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1awiuzw/how_do_i_make_a_chocolate_cake_this_dense_and/kri0f5e

Ice cream cookie cakes using my 9 inch pans. Here’s a funfetti cookie with vanilla ice cream ,"That looks amazing! In the early 2000s, my cousin and I would only ask for these kinds of cakes for our birthdays. My mum would use a bag of chocolate chip cookie mix and flatten the dough out on a full sized baking sheet, and once it was baked, cut it in half to make the top and bottom for the sandwhich. She'd then cut thick slices from a box of Chapman's ice cream and cover the bottom cookie in a layer. I specifically remember when she used the Canadian vanilla ice cream. It looked cool with a bunch of maple leaves before she covered it with the top.

2024-10-09 03:10:46,baking,cake,1fzf18a,lr1fxs0,Made this lemon poppy seed cake with lemon and raspberry glaze today. ,"LEMON POPPY SEED LOAF CAKE WITH LEMON AND RASPBERRY GLAZE

CAKE RECIPE:

INGREDIENTS

1.75 cup flour

1.5 teaspoon baking powder

.25 teaspoon baking soda

.25 teaspoon salt

3 eggs

1 cup sugar

.75 cup sour cream or greek yogurt 

.5 cup vegetable oil

zest of two lemons

3 tablespoon lemon juice

1 tablespoon lemon extract

.5 teaspoon vanilla extract

2 tablespoon poppy seeds

DIRECTIONS

Preheat the oven to 350F and line a 9×5 loaf pan with parchment paper and set aside.

In a medium bowl, rub the sugar and the lemon zest together using your fingers to allow the lemon oil to come through in the sugar. (Roughly 5 minutes)

In a mixing bowl cream the eggs, lemon zest sugar, and sour cream together until light and fluffy. (Peaks won’t form but the egg mixture will lighten in color by a few shades) I use a kitchen aid whisk attachment on speed 5 for 7-8 minutes. 

Add in the vegetable oil and mix slowly. Add in the vanilla extract and lemon extract, and mix on medium speed for 2-3 minutes to combine.

Add in the flour, baking powder, baking soda, poppy seeds, and salt and mix just until combined. Do not overmix! Mix just until there are no large lumps or streaks of flour in the batter. 

Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and bake for 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. 

Allow cake to cool completely IN THE PAN before glazing. Glazing in the pan helps to keep the icing on the top only as it sets after 10 minutes or so and stays in place! 

RASPBERRY PURÉE

24 oz Unsweetened Frozen Raspberries

1/4 to 1/2 cup white sugar (or to taste)

1 tsp lemon juice 

Blend room temperature raspberries for 90 seconds. Add blended raspberries to medium sized bowl and add sugar and lemon juice. Whisk together well until sugar has fully dissolved. 

*Optional: After blending raspberries and before incorporating other ingredients you can strain the raspberry purée through a fine mesh strainer to remove the seeds if you prefer a seedless purée. 


LEMON GLAZE 

1.5 cup powdered sugar 

2 tablespoon lemon juice

.5 tablespoon milk

.5 tablespoon unsalted butter melted

In a medium bowl, add the powdered sugar, milk, lemon juice, and melted butter and whisk to combine.

Pour lemon glaze over cake. Immediately spoon stripes of raspberry puree directly on top of lemon glaze (the lemon glaze sets very quickly!).  Use a toothpick and drag through glaze in a zigzag pattern to blend the glaze and purée together. 

*TIP* The lemon glaze sets extremely quickly so I ALWAYS make the raspberry purée first and have it ready before I make the lemon glaze to ensure the smoothest application and end result!",51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1fzf18a/made_this_lemon_poppy_seed_cake_with_lemon_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1fzf18a/made_this_lemon_poppy_seed_cake_with_lemon_and/lr1fxs0

2024-11-27 16:42:34,baking,cake,1h18gys,lz9k0sj,Mango Coconut Mirror Glazed Mousse Cake my daughter & I made!,"Our mousse cake consists of a coconut dacquoise, mango crémeux, mango compote and coconut mousse.  
We mostly followed the recipe here: [https://sugargeekshow.com/recipe/mango-mousse-cake/](https://sugargeekshow.com/recipe/mango-mousse-cake/)  except for the mirror glaze, I wanted to do one with white chocolate so we used the glaze from this recipe: [https://www.loveandoliveoil.com/2018/07/mini-blueberry-mousse-cakes-with-mirror-glaze.html](https://www.loveandoliveoil.com/2018/07/mini-blueberry-mousse-cakes-with-mirror-glaze.html)

We did not have Pectin NH for the compote and was not going to buy some when I only needed 2 grams so I just used corn starch and it worked well.

It was our first time doing a mirror glaze so were half expecting to mess it up but it turned out great!

Lemon Blueberry Cake:

Indulge in the resplendent symphony of our Lemon Blueberry Cake, where the zest of sun-drenched lemons entwines gracefully with the succulent, jewel-like blueberries. Each bite is a crescendo of vibrant citrus notes, delicately balanced by the natural sweetness of ripe berries, creating a harmonious dance upon your palate. The cake, tender and moist, serves as the perfect canvas, elevating the luscious, fruit-laden swirls that adorn it. This confection is a celebration of summer’s bountiful embrace, a tribute to nature’s artistry, and a testament to the exquisite craft of our master pâtissier (hey that's me!).


Vanilla Bean Cake:

Experience the sublime elegance of our Vanilla Bean Cake, a timeless creation that exudes sophistication and grace. The essence of the finest vanilla beans is meticulously infused into every tender crumb, enveloping your senses in a warm, aromatic embrace. The cake’s ethereal texture, both light and decadent, reveals layers of nuanced flavor, each more enchanting than the last.

Honestly, I know you have to undercut yourself because you are at university and people are comparing your price to the price of a walmart slice but you're massively shorting yourself... your chocolate cake pic you've cut 1/4 of the cake into 3 slices meaning you're currently making $36 gross per cake IF you sell out completely, for someone who is so skillful and obviously invested a lot of time in their craft you deserve to do better than break even on ingredients for your cakes and having to donate a bunch of your spare time into packing and selling. If you set your price higher, people will rise to meet it because your product is unique artisan crafted food. The higher price will offsete not selling through everything, and then you can stock up on freezer slices to bring around to sell in a discount bundle later.",14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1gquatv/cake_slices/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1gquatv/cake_slices/lx2wcg8

Thank you very much for all the answers (and u/Ok_Nefariousness4356 for the kind words...).  
I was not expecting such a consensus. Clearly something went wrong, so I will go in the shop tomorrow morning.

To the baker's credit, since I forgot to mention it in my original post:

- the external presentation and flavour were nice. The recipient of the cake was pleased when I presented it (a bit less once we saw the inside).

- I did leave the order until the last minute. When I went in the shop in the morning, asking to pick up this evening, she had to check her schedule. Then said she would be able to bake mine and shift some other orders around. Maybe she bit more than she could chew after all.

Oh well. Again thanks to everyone.",275,https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1fuq5o5/am_i_right_in_thinking_this_cake_is_not_how_it_is/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1fuq5o5/am_i_right_in_thinking_this_cake_is_not_how_it_is/lq1e90y

Cooked icings are meant to be poured onto the cake and worked with very, very quickly as the cooked sugar sets up. Messing with it once it has cooled too much will only mess up the finish. You’re better to not worry too much if you’re not able to cover the sides completely. If the recipe doesn’t provide temperature details (or instructions to not stir), might be worth looking for a new recipe that is more exact. The sugar can very easily go too far with instructions to just boil, which means the icing will set up that much faster and be even harder to work with.

2024-08-01 18:09:10,baking,cake,1ehmuuo,lg0gwus,Grandmother’s Icing Recipe… how do I make it look “pretty” on my cake?,"your sugar to milk/butter ratio might have bern off, maybe there wasn’t enough liquid? or you needed more fat. Either one could lead to the frosting crumbling like that. 

The cooking may have done it as well, if it was too hot, that can also make the sugar crystalize like that. You could try researching candy temps and see what you’d want to aim for when making frosting. 

Otherwise, you could try making it the usual way without cooking, and see if that helps while preserving the flavor.

EDIT: So after learning more from some of the replies, I realize this is a special type of frosting for Texas sheet cake. It looks similar to making a ganache, and is also expected to look glossy. That said, the recipe I’m looking at uses powdered sugar and lower heat than you mentioned, so that may make a difference. [the recipe](https://sugarspunrun.com/best-texas-sheet-cake-recipe/)

2024-08-01 21:13:45,baking,cake,1ehmuuo,lg1giop,Grandmother’s Icing Recipe… how do I make it look “pretty” on my cake?,"Boiled frosting! They are a tricky beast! Instead of following the timing guideline, get a candy thermometer and cook the sugar to about 240F. That should sort out the texture. If you’re still having issues, you could add some corn syrup or cream of tartar to the recipe and they will help prevent that matte crystallization.

EDIT- just re-read and saw “the more I mess with it the more it crumbled”- sugar is aching to crystallize when it melts. Stirring it too long can make it seize up like it has here. After you add vanilla, you really just want to stir it enough to start getting thick then pour the frosting over each layer of the cake.",11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1ehmuuo/grandmothers_icing_recipe_how_do_i_make_it_look/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1ehmuuo/grandmothers_icing_recipe_how_do_i_make_it_look/lg1giop

Try poking it early so you can see what happens when the cake isn't fully cooked and compare to when it's cooked.

Also, just put the buttercream in the middle and on top if you want it to look tidier. No need to try to put it on the edge, that's an advanced skill, and I don't think cream cheese based icing is likely to be firm enough to do the edges neatly anyway.

2024-11-12 20:29:29,baking,cake,1gpukuv,lwt0dyh,I made a mocha tres leches cake ☺️,"My teeth hurt from a sugar overload after demolishing one slice, but it’s worth it 😭. 

Preheat oven to 165c. For the sponge cake, whisk together 178g plain flour, 250g sugar, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt & 1 tsp espresso powder in a large bowl then set aside.

In a medium saucepan over a low heat, combine 1 cup whole milk, 235g chopped bittersweet chocolate & 75g cocoa powder. Stir continuously until the chocolate melts & the mixture looks like a chocolate sauce. Let it cool slightly. 

Once slightly cooled, whisk in 2/3s of a cup vegetable oil, 4 eggs and a tsp of vanilla extract. Whisk until smooth then pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and fold in until fully combined. 

Pour batter into a lightly sprayed cake pan then gently tap the pan against the kitchen counter to get rid of air bubbles, or pop them with a toothpick or fork.  Bake the cake for around 30-40 minutes, rotating half way through. Insert a toothpick into the middle & it should come out crumbly but clean, with no wet batter. 

While cake is baking, in another saucepan set over low heat, combine approximately 397g can of sweetened condensed milk, 1 cup evaporated milk, half a cup double cream, 2 tbsp cocoa powder, 1.5 teaspoons of espresso powder & half a tsp of cinnamon. Whisk vigorously until the cocoa, espresso & cinnamon are fully dissolved then set aside to cool.

Let your baked cake cool for around 10 minutes then poke it all over with a toothpick. Slowly pour the warm tres leches mixture evenly over the cake. Let the cake cool fully otherwise your whipped cream mixture will melt.

To make the whipped cream mixture, whisk two cups of cold double cream, 1 tbsp of cocoa powder & 1 tsp of espresso powder. Whisk until soft peaks start forming (don’t overdo it). Spread the whipped cream over the chilled tres leches cake & dust the top with cocoa powder. 

Enjoy!",111,https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1gpukuv/i_made_a_mocha_tres_leches_cake/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1gpukuv/i_made_a_mocha_tres_leches_cake/lwt0dyh
