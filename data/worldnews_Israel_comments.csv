# The US threatens Israel: resolve the humanitarian crisis in Gaza - or we will impose an arms embargo

  
Translation:

The US sent a clear message to Israel, according to which the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip must be resolved within a month, and if not, an arms embargo will be imposed on it, N12 learned today (Tuesday). A letter to ministers Ron Dermer and Yoav Galant, where the demand was conveyed.

""In accordance with Israel's commitment in March 2024 to allow and not prevent the transfer of American humanitarian aid or aid supported by the administration in Gaza, the State Department must conduct an audit in accordance with the aid law,"" it said.

The administration expressed deep concern over the ""deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Gaza in recentweeks"", and raised a demand to see urgent steps within the next month in order to reverse the trend. The Americanspoint out that since the promises made in March, the lowest amount of aid entering the Strip was recorded in September.

""In order to change the negative humanitarian trend and in accordance with its promises, Israel must take concrete steps within 30 days. Failure to implement these steps may lead to consequences for the policy of the United States in accordance with American law (the foreign aid program to Israel - arms embargo).""",415,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1g47a7t/us_threatens_israel_resolve_humanitarian_crisis/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1g47a7t/us_threatens_israel_resolve_humanitarian_crisis/ls17kc6

Why threaten Israel with an arms embargo 3 weeks before an election in the US and give Israel a date to comply of 30 days?

1. Almost a year ago, an Iranian backed terrorist organization commits an ISIS style terror attack killing 1200 Israelis (mostly civilians).

2. Israel attacks said Iranian backed terrorists

3. An Iranian backed terrorist group and partial government of a neighboring country launches attacks at Israel for the past year.

4. Israel attacks said Iranian backed terrorist group, killing their leader.

5. The nation of Iran launches the largest ballistic missile attack in human history at Israel.

Can’t a person make a strong argument that Iran (through its proxies) started attacking Israel a year ago? Even argue it started a war on October 7th? Why is there this entitlement by Iran they can do this and this unrealistic standard that Israel should “exercise restraint and not escalate”? 

Would the US exercise restraint? Would Russia/China/India? Would IRAN EXERCISE RESTRAINT if Israeli backed terrorist organizations attacked them for a year??

2024-10-05 19:28:52,worldnews,Israel,1fwy8g3,lqi4ra5,Netanyahu denounces Macron over calls to stop arms deliveries to Israel,"From The Telegraph:

[Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/01/benjamin-netanyahu-asked-vladimir-putin-stop-iran/), Israel’s prime minister, issued a furious denunciation of [French president Emmanuel Macron](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/03/eu-could-die-says-emmanuel-macron-us-china-nato/) on Saturday over the latter’s calls for a worldwide arms embargo on Israel.

“I have a message for [president Macron](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/emmanuel-macron/),” Mr Netanyahu said in a video address.

“Israel will win with or without” the support of France, the prime minister said, as he cited the threats to Israel on seven fronts.

Referring to Mr Macron’s remarks as a “disgrace”, Mr Netanyahu said France’s “shame will continue long after the war is won”.

He added that “Iran is behind all the threats against us”.

Mr Netanyahu said: “No country in the world would accept such an attack,” as the one Iran delivered on Tuesday, when [200 missiles were fired at Israel](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/02/how-iran-could-breach-israel-air-defences-missiles/).

“Israel will not accept it either. Israel has the duty and the right to defend itself and respond to such attacks – and this is what we are going to do.”

Mr Macron said: “I think that today, the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza.”

Later, he added that he “regrets” Mr Netanyahu’s decision to launch a ground invasion in Lebanon.

The denunciation came as Israel is increasingly confident it has killed the likely successor to Hassan Nasrallah, former Hezbollah leader, in an air strike.

[Contact with Hashem Safieddine has been lost since the Israeli attack on Beirut](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/05/israel-iran-war-lebanon-hezbollah-latest-news/) on Thursday night, a high-level Hezbollah source told AFP.

“We don’t know if he was at the targeted site, or who may have been there with him,” the source said.

Israel’s strike at Hezbollah’s underground intelligence headquarters in the suburb of Dahiyeh involved around 60 tons of bombs, according to Israel’s N12 news.

Saudi TV channel Al Hadath quoted sources who said that “the scope of the attack in Beirut, which was aimed at the culprit Safieddine, leaves no room to escape alive”.

Reuters quoted Lebanese security sources who said Israeli strikes on Dahiyeh have kept rescue workers from scouring the site of the attack.

Hezbollah has made no comment since the attack.

> US Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, said on Tuesday that Iran was a &quot;Dangerous&quot; and &quot;Destabilising&quot; force in the Middle East and Washington was committed to Israel&#039;s security.

> WHY IT&#039;S IMPORTANT. The comments from Harris, who faces Republican former President Donald Trump in the November 5 US election, came hours after Iran fired ballistic missiles at Israel in retaliation for Israel&#039;s military campaign in Lebanon, drawing vows of a sharp response from Israel and the US. No injuries were reported in Israel and Washington called Iran&#039;s attack ineffective.

> Israel&#039;s military campaign in Lebanon is in addition to its war in Gaza that followed a deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Palestinian Hamas militants.

There is so much here that I *refuse* to believe can't be alleviated on a macro level. Does Israel really need to kick these Palestinians off of this land? Is it really reasonable that the Palestinians living there couldn't have gotten permits all this time? Even if they could have and they didn't- we can't issue them permits now? How valuable is this archaeological site when the community was built in the 80s and then the demolition judgement was on pause for the last 7 years after that?

Israel needs some serious self-reflection that I hope its capable of come its next elections. The IDF shouldn't be facilitating this- and it shouldn't be facilitating settler terrorism either. It doesn't matter how many Palestinians do vile murders and rapes and destructions across the country- this *cannot* be the answer- it does not need to be so it shouldn't be. The country would be so much more powerful and defensible on the world stage if it were to do hard crackdowns on this kind of shit- but it feels like doing that would lead to civil strife without left-wing or centrist control of government.

And then the Civil Administration order the destruction of the village for Oct 1st with relocation just three kilometers away on territory still inside Area C but closer to area A & B.

Let's say Israel goes into Rafah, kills 1000 terrorists and 2000 civilians while pushing 1.5 million people into even worse situations than they already are.

Then what?

Israel can claim victory all they want but if world opinion is worse for them than before oct 7 and there are still 1.5 million angry desperate Muslims in Gaza then we will just see a continuation of the war where Iran and others supply money and arms to the small percentage of that 1.5 million who turn to terrorism.

We've seen this before....

I'm very doubtful the war will help Israel's long term success.

The fact of the matter is that Iran has no good options here, if it loses Hezbollah it loses the only meaningful deterrent it has against Israeli air attacks against its nuclear facilities and critical infrastructure. If it fights to defend Hezbollah, it will commit the axis of resistance to war with Israel on Israel's terms.

2024-10-26 10:41:11,worldnews,Israel,1gci9fh,lttxegw,Israel sent message to Iran ahead of attack and warned against response,"Israel sent a message to Iran on Friday ahead of its retaliatory airstrikes warning the Iranians not to respond, three sources with knowledge of the issue told Axios.

*Why it matters:* The Israeli message was an attempt to limit the ongoing exchange of attacks between Israel and Iran and prevent a wider escalation, the sources said.

*Driving the news:* U.S. and Israeli officials said three waves of airstrikes took place on Saturday morning local time.

The first wave focused on Iran's air defense system and the second and third waves focused on missile and drone bases and weapons' productions sites.

Iran said it defeated the Israeli attack and that only ""limited damage"" was done to military targets around the country.

Israeli officials said the attack was in retaliation for Iran's massive ballistic missile attack on October 1.
Behind the scenes: The Israeli message was conveyed to the Iranians through several third parties, the sources said.

""The Israelis made it clear to the Iranians in advance what they are going to attack in general and what they are not going to attack,"" one source told Axios.

Two other sources said Israel warned the Iranians not to respond to the attack and stressed that if Iran does retaliate, Israel would conduct another more significant attack, especially if Israeli civilians are killed or injured.

The Israeli Prime Minister's Office did not respond for a request for comment.

Iran has said it doesn't want a full-blown war with Israel but that it would retaliate if attacked.

On Saturday, IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a briefing with reporters that if Iran escalates in response to the Israeli strikes, Israel will be compelled to retaliate.

A U.S. official said the U.S. didn't participate in the Israeli operation but that if Iran retaliates, the U.S. is ready to defend Israel against such an attack.

""This should be the end of the direct military exchange between Israel and Iran,"" the official added. ""If Iran attacks Israel again there will be consequences. We communicated that directly and indirectly to Iran.""

*What they're saying:* One of the channels for conveying messages to Iran ahead of the Israeli strike was Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldcamp, one source said.

""I spoke with the Iranian Foreign Minister about war and the heightened tensions in the region. Regarding the latter, I urged for restraint. All parties must work to prevent further escalation,"" Veldcamp wrote on X several hours before the Israeli attack.
What to watch: U.S. officials said they expect Iran to respond to the Israeli attack in the coming days but in a limited way that will enable Israel to stop the tit-for-tat cycle.

""It is our aim to accelerate diplomacy and de-escalate tensions in the Middle East region. We urge Iran to cease its attacks on Israel so that this cycle of fighting can end without further escalation,"" National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said.",274,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1gci9fh/israel_sent_message_to_iran_ahead_of_attack_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1gci9fh/israel_sent_message_to_iran_ahead_of_attack_and/lttxegw

In the last 24 hours, the following has happened:

- Smotrich freezes all the tax money payable the Palestinian Authority from Palestinian imports+exports, intending to cause its collapse and calls for settlements in Area A area such as Jenin. Even though the PA has literally killed and arrested hundreds of PIJ+Hamas terrorists over the past several months in the West Bank and has allowed the IDF to conduct raids against terrorists in Area B+Area A areas

- Gallant allows Israeli settlers to go to Northern West Bank for the first time since Sharon's 2005 disengagement.

- Ben Gvir visited the Temple Mount for the first time since 10/7.

- Smotrich saying that Israel will establish a new settlement for every country that unilaterally recognizes Palestine as a state 

- Amsalem calls for the continuation of the “reform” [judicial coup d’etat] and says that the ombudsman is the most dangerous person for democracy.

- US intelligence says only 30-35% of Hamas pre-10/7 terrorists have been killed (contradicting Bibi's claims of over half being killed to Dr. Phil's podcast recently...not to mention Bibi said Israel was near ""total victory"" nearly four months ago and Gallant said over Hamas is captured+killed a few months ago as well) and says atleast 65% of Hamas's tunnels are in tact. US intelligence says Hamas has been able to recruit thousands of new terrorists during this war so it's obviously lower than 30-35%.",133,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1cy55e2/israel_will_not_transfer_muchneeded_funds_to_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1cy55e2/israel_will_not_transfer_muchneeded_funds_to_the/l576yzz

> Israel considered appealing against his appointment in light of his past conduct but decided against it because of the anti-Israel sentiment prevailing in the international judicial body, a decision that has raised some questions because of Salam&#039;s obvious bias.

> In 2014, he accused Israel of committing crimes against humanity and, in 2016, accused Israel of apartheid.

2. The agreement was to be between Israel and the Lebanese government. The Lebanese government is not a belligerent. The war is between Hezbollah/Iran & Israel. Now the US asks Lebanon to unilaterally declare a a ceasefire under these terms. 

...Maybe they could get the President of Belarus to unilaterally declare a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia. 

3. Everyone is already talking about violating it already. No one is planning to respect it. The Lebanese state has no intention of establishing sovereignty in the south or disarm Hezbollah. Israel fully intends to violate airspace. Objections are therefore neutralized. 

Everyone also seems to think the other parties understand that they won't be restricted by these terms. The Lebanese state/army thinks it's entirely obvious that they can't and won't disarm Hezbollah. They couldn't even disarm fatah... the 57th most powerful militia in the country.

That isn’t how a ceasefire works. You have to discuss the details, to be able to execute the diplomacy, to be able to reach the ceasefire agreement. Not all the way to a final peace treaty, but enough to provide confidence that pausing hostilities is worthwhile.

This is a propaganda statement vs. sincere participation. You can tell because it is pretending the work and negotiation doesn’t need to happen in order for a ceasefire agreement to be reached.

A step in the right direction, but not nearly enough to be real or meaningful.

To put things more bluntly: This is exactly how you (1) enable someone not to participate in the negotiations and then (2) use the fact that they weren’t included in negotiations to violate the resulting ceasefire at their earliest convenience.

Several hours ago, Iran and possibly the Houthis have launched around 100 confirmed pusher propeller drones, which fly at about the speed of a Cessna. It will take them around 9 hours to reach Israel. Iran more recently has launched cruise missiles, which should take about three hours to reach Israel.  Iran's ballistic missiles can hit Israel in 12 minutes.  

The prediction is that they will time all of these attack types to hit Israel at the same time. 

A Red Alert has not yet been issued in Israel, and Israeli and US warplanes (plus unspecified allies) are engaging incoming targets, and the Jordanian military is shooting down targets from the ground.  

Israel has the most layered air defense on the planet, and Iran, the Houthis, and Hezbollah have the largest number and most varied types of different missiles.

2024-07-31 10:08:12,worldnews,Israel,1egim9m,lfsgvjw,Nagasaki mayor says Israel not invited to A-bomb peace ceremony,">The mayor of Nagasaki on Wednesday said Israel would not be invited to the Aug. 9 annual peace ceremony marking the 1945 atomic bombing of the southwestern Japan city, but added there was no ""political"" intention.

>Mayor Shiro Suzuki said in June that he had sent a letter to Israel calling for a cease-fire in the conflict in the Gaza Strip, while leaving an invitation to the ceremony on hold due to the risk of ""unexpected situations"" such as protests amid growing international condemnation.

>At a press conference Wednesday, Suzuki said he has not seen any moves that will mitigate such risks even as the ceremony nears.

>The idea not to invite Israel is ""not a political decision, but is based on our hope that we want the ceremony conducted smoothly under a solemn atmosphere,"" Suzuki said, calling it a ""wrenching decision.""

>The move contrasts with Hiroshima, the other Japanese city hit by a U.S. atomic bomb, which has invited Israel to its ceremony marking the 79th anniversary of the attack on Aug. 6 with a message calling for an immediate cease-fire in the Palestinian territory.

>The Nagasaki mayor said he has already notified Hiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui of his decision, adding that the ""desire to pay respects to the (atomic bomb) victims is the same.""

>Some residents and others have accused the Hiroshima city government of having a double standard, as Russia and Belarus have been barred from the ceremony for three consecutive years over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

>Each year, Hiroshima and Nagasaki invite delegates from countries and regions across the world to attend their respective peace ceremonies to pray for the victims and affirm that humanity cannot coexist with nuclear arms.",655,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1egim9m/nagasaki_mayor_says_israel_not_invited_to_abomb/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1egim9m/nagasaki_mayor_says_israel_not_invited_to_abomb/lfsgvjw

- Sinwar was asking for $500m from Iran, in addition to training 12,000 more Hamas terrorists.  
- In 2021, Sinwar addressed several high ranking Iranian officials, claiming he could completely annihilate Israel within 2 years.  
- Hamas was planning to bring down skyscrapers in and around Tel Aviv, in particular saying that if they succeed in that, it will be a catastrophe for Israel similar to 9/11  
- They planned to use the railway system to move explosives into cities, and convert cars to run on the tracks  
- They also planned to convert fishing boats to fast attack boats that can carry explosives and/or terrorists.  
- They planned to use horse drawn chariots due to their ability to cross rough terrain as well as being quieter and smaller heat signature",1544,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1g293dp/captured_documents_reveal_hamass_broader_ambition/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1g293dp/captured_documents_reveal_hamass_broader_ambition/lrmz5t0
2024-10-12 20:52:44,worldnews,Israel,1g293dp,lrmf1dl,Captured documents reveal Hamas’s broader ambition to wreak havoc on Israel,"Yes, and here is what NATO have long assessed to be Hamas’ tactics in this conflict: https://stratcomcoe.org/cuploads/pfiles/hamas_human_shields.pdf

Hamas relies on the Israeli government’s aim to minimise collateral damage, and is also aware of the West’s sensitivity towards civilian casualties. Hamas’ use of human shields is therefore likely aimed at minimising their own vulnerabilities by limiting the Israeli Defense Forces’ (IDF) freedom of action. It is also aimed at gaining diplomatic and public opinion-related leverage, by presenting Israel and the IDF as an aggressor that indiscriminately strikes civilians.

Hamas’ most common uses of human shields include:

1) Firing rockets, artillery, and mortars from or in proximity to heavily populated civilian areas, often from or near facilities which shoula be protected according to the Geneva convention (e.g. schools, hospitals, or mosques).

2) Locating military or security-related infrastructures such as HQs, bases, armouries, access routes, lathes, or defensive positions within or in proximity to civilian areas.
3) Protecting terrorists’ houses and military facilities, or rescuing terrorists who were besieged or warned by the IDF. ⁠
4) Combating the IDF from or in proximity to residential and commercial areas, including using civilians for intelligence gathering missions.

By engaging in these acts, Hamas employs a win-win scenario: if indeed the IDF uses kinetic power, and the number of civilian causalities surges, Hamas can use that as a weapon in the lawfares it conducts. It would be able to accuse the IDF (and Israel) of committing war crimes, which in turn could result in the imposition of a wide array of sanctions. On the other hand, if the IDF limits its use of military power in Gaza to avoid collateral damage Hamas will be less vulnerable to Israeli attacks, and thereby able to protect its assets while continuing to fight.

We all need to start asking ourselves why we are letting them do this. Here is a way to start - by asking this question: https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/s/EKsbYkhRY2

Edit: And Iran’s response to deploying the obvious countermeasure to ballistic missile attacks on civilian population centers is to call it “dangerous escalation”.

Let's say that Hamas invades Israel, and Iran is still launching missiles at Israel, doing massive damage. Let's say that Israel is at serious risk of being destroyed.

Israel has nuclear weapons. Israel would nuke any serious invading forces. In a scenario where the US isn't backing Israel, and Iran is doing massive damage to Israel, Israel would nuke Iran in return. The Hamas/Iranian plan is idiotic, because if it actually succeeded, it would just result in nuclear war. You can't wipe out a country that has nuclear weapons, unless you're okay with a nuclear exchange.

US support for Israel is the only thing protecting this region from a nuclear war. With US support, with US aircraft and bombs and missiles, none of these countries have any chance of defeating Israel with conventional weapons.

> BEIRUT - The Israeli military said Friday it struck the central headquarters of Hezbollah in Beirut, where a series of massive explosions leveled multiple buildings, sending clouds of orange and black smoke billowing in the skies.

> The strikes in the suburbs south of Lebanon&#039;s capital came shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the U.N., vowing that Israel&#039;s campaign against Hezbollah would continue.

> In Gaza, Israel has vowed to dismantle Hamas&#039; military and political regime, but the goal in Lebanon is just to push Hezbollah away from the border with Israel - &quot;Not a high bar like Gaza&quot; in terms of operational objectives, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to military briefing guidelines.

2024-08-05 13:21:02,worldnews,Israel,1eknlwj,lglqrzd,IDF prepares for 'infiltration' ground assault on Israel,"***The Telegraph reports:***

Israel sent troops to bolster its borders with the West Bank to prepare for a [possible ground assault](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/08/05/israel-iran-hamas-war-latest/) orchestrated by Hamas and Iran.

Additional forces were deployed to cities to foil any infiltration attempt, following a deadly knife attack on Sunday that left two people killed in the city of Holon in central Israel, Israel’s Army Radio, run by the armed forces, reported.

It came as Israel was braced for a major attack likely by air from Iran following the [assassination of Ismail Haniyeh](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/07/31/assassination-ismail-haniyeh-tehran-middle-east-peace/), the Hamas leader, in Tehran on Wednesday. 

Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, told G7 allies that an attack, likey with missiles and drones, could begin as early as Monday, sources told US media.

The G7 countries issued a joint statement, urging all involved parties “once again to refrain from perpetuating the current [destructive cycle of retaliatory violence](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/07/29/israel-hamas-war-gaza-lebanon-hezbollah-strikes-latest-news/), to lower tensions and engage constructively toward de-escalation”.

# Iran dismisses attempts to de-escalate

Iran on Monday issued public flight operations notices advising aircrafts to change their routes in a sign that missile and drone launches were imminent. Lufthansa, the German airline giant, said that its flights would avoid Iraqi and Iranian airspace until at least Aug 7.

Tehran has dismissed attempts by Arab nations and the US to de-escalate the situation, saying [it will attack Israel](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/08/04/iranian-attack-on-israel-could-happen-as-early-as-monday/) even if it means sparking a war, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Which has been an issue raised time and time again:  the number of civilian deaths to militants appears excessive, the degree of infrastructure destruction is extreme. 

They claim the soldiers were not aware of the charity vehicles, it beggars belief that’s the case - but accepting that, what exactly are these aid agencies meant to do to prevent similar happening again?

They also claim that because it was night the drones could not see that the vehicles were labeled with the charity - I don’t believe that at all.

> Military spokespeople said that under the Israeli army’s rules of engagement, officers must have more than one reason for identifying someone as a target before they can be hit. But the investigation determined that a colonel had authorized the series of deadly drone strikes on the convoy based on one major’s observation — from grainy drone-camera footage — that someone in the convoy was armed. That observation turned out to be untrue, military officials said.

> The army said the colonel and the major were dismissed, while three other officers were reprimanded, the most senior of whom was the head of the Southern Command. It said the results of its investigation were turned over to the military’s advocate general, who will decide whether the officers or anyone else involved in the killings should receive further punishment or be prosecuted.

> [...]

> The investigation, headed by Yoav Har-Even, a retired general, found two major areas of wrongdoing.
> It faulted officers for failing to read messages alerting troops that cars, not aid trucks, would carry workers from the charity away from the warehouse where aid was distributed. As a result, the cars that were targeted were misidentified as transporting militants.

> The army also faulted a major who identified the strike target and a colonel who approved the strike for acting with insufficient information.

> The army said the order was given after one of the passengers inside a car was identified as a gunman. It said troops became suspicious because a gunman had been seen on the roof of one of the delivery trucks on the way to the warehouse. 

> The army showed reporters footage of the gunman firing his weapon while riding atop one of the trucks — video that The Associated Press could not independently verify.

> After the aid was dropped off at a warehouse, an officer believed he had spotted a gunman boarding one of the cars. The passenger, it turned out, was not carrying a weapon — the military said it’s possible he was just carrying a bag.",766,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1bwfeor/israel_dismisses_2_officers_over_deadly_drone/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1bwfeor/israel_dismisses_2_officers_over_deadly_drone/ky6eefg

2024-02-19 21:00:37,worldnews,Israel,1auu1ay,kr6yzkr,Israel declares Brazil's Lula persona non grata for comparing Gaza war to Holocaust,"Let's compare the Gaza war with the Holocaust.

Holocaust: Launched as an antisemitic and unprovoked genocide campaign. There were over 6 million Jews killed, out of a European population of about 9 million, about 66% of all Jews in Europe (or about 50x more than Gaza by comparison). There were no military or terrorist deaths. The few who resisted were killed, but don't number very highly, and make up less than 10% of the dead (if I'm being incredibly charitable; I bet they didn't even make up 1%). Those Jews were defenseless, and slaughtered in gas chambers, bullets in their heads, etc., **in an industrial way**.

Gaza war: Launched in response to 10/7. There have been ~28,000 deaths, or about 1.4% of the Gaza population. That's according to Hamas. The best statistics we have available suggest Israel has killed over 10,000 members of Hamas. Many of the dead civilians have been killed because they were being used as human shields, or were killed by Hamas rockets falling short on Gazans themselves, like the Al Ahli Hospital (where one rocket killed over 100 Gazan civilians). Comparable wars with urban fighting, in less dense areas, with a less entrenched enemy, with less use of human shields, frequently see up to 90% of casualties be civilians. In this war, the estimate is somewhere closer to 60% casualties, even ignoring that some of those are due to Hamas rockets.

While individual Gazans may have been killed by soldiers acting illegally in a few cases, this is not the norm or the policy. If it was, then Israel would not have dropped over 60,000 tons of bombs and killed less than 30,000 people, many of them terrorists. When the Allies bombed Dresden in WWII, they dropped 4,000 tons of bombs and killed 25,000 people in two days. When the Nazis liquidated the Warsaw Ghetto, they killed over 250,000 Jews (50-75% of the Jewish population of Warsaw at the time) in less time than this war has gone on. Israel has dropped 15x more bombs than the Allies did on Dresden, a less dense city, and killed roughly the same number of people, many of them terrorists. This suggests clear distinction and targeting of terrorists. If Israel wanted to treat Gaza like the Nazis treated Jews, Gaza would not just be flat, there would be over 1 million casualties, and likely closer to 1.5 million.

There are less than 30,000.

Hamas puts anyone under 17 as a child in these reports, and again, doesn't mention if they were fighting or not. Same goes for the women.

As for Hamas themselves, many of them are fighting while wearing civilian clothes as well (There are videos about it), so once they are dead, they write them as civilians.

Lastly, ""The ministry of Health"" in Gaza is run by Hamas (like every other thing there), so their numbers in general are questionable. When the Al Shifa hostpital bombing happend, within minutes they reported about 500 dead, which is not possible to confirm at that point (it was also pitch black at that hour) and was proven wrong later on.

In fact, she points out that about the only time women don't get raped by the enemy or even their own army passing through is when women are armed to the point that soldiers are afraid to mess with civilians. Even then, they don't escape unscathed, but they reduce the rapings. It's such a huge problem as well because it is difficult to get accountability because they are soldiers in war so incredibly difficult to prosecute. 

She cites examples going back 4000 years all the way to the 1990s when she first published where women got raped in war and basically couldn't hold anyone accountable, but this certainly goes to show that any idea of peaceful, neighborly friendship after this war is naive at best. It will be decades before some families recover.

Edit: From the article ""Israeli officials have speculated in recent days that Hamas refused to release the women due to concerns that their accounts from captivity could significantly tarnish Hamas's reputation.""

Of course, however, the Israeli government knew that the implication would be a de facto expulsion of Norwegian diplomats to Palestine. The above argument was a pretext. The *real* view, on part of Israel, is that Norway has (post-2023, at least) taken a one-sided anti-Israel approach — coming down harder on Israel for their response to October 7th than on Palestine for October 7th — and that Israel is retaliating against Norway for their recognition of Palestinian statehood.

Not to mention his complete disregard for an actual end game and a myopic focus on small tactical victories rather than a sweeping operation to establish land control when good will was there was absolutely maddening. I see the argument that they're saving forces ""for the real war"", but is this not it - the war to end the never ending saga of dealing with hostile Palestinians? Who is going to engage in a land war? Hezbollah who fights like a conventional opponent (not to diminish their rocket and missile inventory - but an invasion?)? The fucking Syrians?

The West Bank should be a state with close Israeli intelligence community oversight and Gaza should already be secure with a puppet government technically under the PA should consolidating power and behind a Saudi and Egyptian secret police apparatus along with a new educational system with zero UN input and a new Marshal Plan.

Instead of we have growing Israeli isolation with no end of this war in sight with no plan and the fucking settlers in the West Bank running amok as complete cunts to top it all off.

You can believe something is just and still understand how politics and more importantly incentives work. All Hamas has to do is maximize suffering it seems and they get what they want which is the opposite of a global rules based order.

People don't understand how this stuff works and honestly. This is my opinion but if I were the president I would definitely be thinking that i don't support the rules based order anymore because most of the world is Undermining it by protecting it.

It is like the ICC Israel thing. They don't realize that they are undermining their legitimacy by going after it since the only people that will ever be held accountable that aren't 3rd world despots are Western States. Russia, Iran, China are never going to be held accountable by the ICC and the population doesn't care.

The ICC doing this is just a feather in the cap of the people trying to undermine the rules based order because the people in Western States will use it to bludgeon western democracies and so forth.

Unironically I feel like world leaders have yet to take a course in realpolitik but maybe they should because this is some of the most braindead stuff I have ever seen.

2024-10-21 04:10:16,worldnews,Israel,1g8h9kj,lsyh0hq,Israel gave the White House its demands for ending the war in Lebanon,"Israel gave the U.S. a document last week with its conditions for a diplomatic solution to end the war in Lebanon and allow displaced civilians from both sides of the border to return to their homes, two U.S. officials and two Israeli officials told Axios.

*Why it matters:* The Israeli Prime Minister's Office gave the paper to the White House ahead of President Biden's envoy Amos Hochstein's visit to Beirut on Monday to discuss a diplomatic solution to the conflict, Israeli officials said.

*Behind the scenes:* The U.S. and Israeli officials told Axios Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, who is a confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, sent the document to Hochstein on Thursday.

Israeli officials said the paper came out of discussions Dermer had with the Israeli Ministry of Defense and the Israel Defense Forces about the principles Israel demands be part of any diplomatic solution to end the war with Hezbollah.

One Israeli demand is that the IDF be allowed to engage in ""active enforcement"" to make sure Hezbollah doesn't rearm and rebuild its military infrastructure in the areas of southern Lebanon that are close to the border, an Israeli official said.
The official added that Israel also demands its air force have freedom of operation in Lebanese air space.

*Friction point:* These two demands contradict UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which states that the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) enforce a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.

""We are talking about 1701 with increased enforcement. Our main message is that if the Lebanese army and UNIFIL do more, the IDF will do less and the other way around"", the Israeli official told me.

A U.S. official said it is highly unlikely Lebanon and the international community would agree to these conditions, which would dramatically undermine Lebanon's sovereignty.
The White House and the Israeli embassy in Washington declined to comment.

*Driving the news:* Hochstein is expected to arrive in Beirut on Monday and meet with acting prime minister Najib Mikati, speaker of parliament Nabih Berri and other Lebanese officials and discuss the Israeli demands.

Berri told Al-Arabiya on Sunday that Hochstein's visit is ""the last chance before the U.S. elections to reach a solution"" to the war in Lebanon.
He stressed there is consensus in Lebanon about UN Resolution 1701 and made clear he refuses to amend it in any way, which is effectively what Israel is demanding.

*Between the lines:* Hochstein is pushing for a wide-ranging deployment of the Lebanese armed forces in southern Lebanon as part of every diplomatic solution that ends the war in Lebanon, U.S. and Israeli officials say.

In recent years, the Lebanese army had very limited forces in the area, which was mostly controlled by Hezbollah.

Hochstein wants to have at least 8,000 Lebanese troops deployed in southern Lebanon, the officials said.
The U.S. envoy also wants to upgrade UNIFIL's mandate so it would be able to help the Lebanese army prevent armed individuals or groups who are not under the control of the Lebanese government from being deployed near the border with Israel.

U.S. officials admit that since the 2006 war, UNIFIL barely enforced resolution 1701 and didn't prevent Hezbollah from building wide-ranging military infrastructure in southern Lebanon in violation of the resolution.

*State of play:* On Sunday night ahead of Hochstein's visit, the Israeli Air Force conducted airstrikes across Lebanon against dozens of targets affiliated with Hezbollah's bank, including a building in Beirut, the IDF said.

Israel said it would revive stalled cease-fire talks with Hamas after social media video showing female Israeli soldiers being abducted by the militants on Oct. 7 sparked a public outcry.

The 190-second clip, compiled from footage filmed by the militants on the day of the attack, shows five young women in civilian clothes, some bruised and bloodied, lined up against a wall before being pushed into a jeep.

The women, who Israel confirmed are military personnel, were kidnapped when Hamas invaded Israel and killed 1,200 people. The attack triggered an Israeli military response that’s destroyed much of Gaza and killed more than 35,000 Palestinians.

In a statement, Hamas said the video showed “deliberate distortions” and dismissed the women’s injuries as ""something to be expected.""",1571,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1cyo518/israel_to_restart_gaza_talks_after_hostage_video/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1cyo518/israel_to_restart_gaza_talks_after_hostage_video/l5ap21b

Negotiations were supposed to lead to a lasting ceasefire, per the [UN Security Resolution passed last month](https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-793653), and mediators from Egypt, Qatar, and the US have worked to try and broach a deal since the conflict broke out in October.

Negotiators were hoping to achieve a six-week ceasefire and a three-phase framework to secure the release of sick, elderly, and wounded hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners and increased humanitarian aid.

  
Hamas demanded that there be unrestricted return of Gazans to the north and that IDF troops would withdraw.

  
CIA Director William Burns, Mossad Director David Barnea, and Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) Director Ronen Bar were expected to meet in Egypt this weekend to continue ceasefire talks.

However, the latest rejection by Hamas has led Israeli officials to publically wonder whether there is any point in continuing negotiations, according to a report by public broadcaster KAN11.

The trio met last month in Doha for talks with mediators, but no clear breakthrough was reached.

Israel is reportedly pushing both Egypt and Qatar to put pressure on Hamas, with threats to pull out of the Cairo negotiations fully.

Israel has been under increased pressure to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza since the start of the war.

Still, pressure increased last week after the killing of seven foreign aid workers led to the withdrawal of the aid company's services.

  
The pressure led to Israel reopening the Erez crossing for the first time since it was destroyed on October 7, as well as opening up the port in Ashdod to aid deliveries. Kerem Shalom will also be opened.

The cabinet also approved on Friday evening the arrival of Jordanian army trucks carrying humanitarian aid to come through Israeli territory directly to the Gaza Strip.

  
The plan is for the trucks to enter through the Allenby crossing in a convoy to Kerem Shalom, where they will be inspected - and from there, they will continue on to Gaza.",785,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1bwqvg7/hamas_rejects_israels_latest_hostage_deal/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1bwqvg7/hamas_rejects_israels_latest_hostage_deal/ky7v215

Shortly after 9/11 based on Documents in Bin Ladens hideout, AL Queda was in disarray. But due to the invasion in Iraq and Afghanistan it lead to the future formation of modern day ISIS.

And so, to fight back, these tactics are needed.

If the UN wants peace, it needs to realize it needs to actually police people. It needs to be willing to take the pain to help people, or it can’t be surprised when people start ignoring them.

2024-01-04 14:54:51,worldnews,Israel,18yer8w,kga94es,US rebukes South Africa for 'meritless' genocide suit against Israel,"“We find this submission meritless, counterproductive, completely without any basis in fact whatsoever,” said U.S. National Security Council Spokesperson John Kirby.

A PDF of South Africa's full 84-page submission to the ICJ is linked **[HERE](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24252642/192-20231228-app-01-00-en.pdf)**

_______

**EDIT:** Adding more context on the submission below, in case folks want to dispute any specific allegations or call out anything misleading. 

These are the sections of the submission which allegedly evidence genocidal acts committed against Palestinian people:

* Killing Palestinians in Gaza (para 45, pg 31)
* Causing Serious Bodily and Mental Harm to Palestinians in Gaza (para 51, pg 35)
* Mass expulsion from homes and displacement of Palestinians in Gaza (para 55, pg 37)
* Deprivation of access to adequate food and water to Palestinians in Gaza (para 61, pg 40)
* Deprivation of access to adequate shelter, clothes, hygiene and sanitation to Palestinians
in Gaza (para 71, pg 45)
* Deprivation of adequate medical assistance to Palestinians in Gaza (para 76, pg 48)
* Destruction of Palestinian life in Gaza (para 88, pg 54)
* Imposing measures intended to prevent Palestinian births (para 95, pg 57)

The section of the submission allegedly evidencing expressions of genocidal intent against the Palestinian people by Israeli State Officials and others can be found from para 101, pages 59 to 65. Here are some example quotes used:

> * — **President of Israel:** On 12 October 2023, President Isaac Herzog made clear that Israel was not distinguishing between militants and civilians in Gaza, stating in a press conference to foreign media — in relation Palestinians in Gaza, over one million of whom are children: *“It’s an entire nation out there that is responsible. It’s not true this rhetoric about civilians not aware not involved. It’s absolutely not true. … and we will fight until we break their backbone.”*
> 
> * — **Israeli Minister of Heritage:** On 1 November 2023, Amichai Eliyahu posted on Facebook: *“The north of the Gaza Strip, more beautiful than ever. Everything is blown up and flattened, simply a pleasure for the eyes""* 
> 
> * — **Israeli Minister of Defence:** On 9 October 2023, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant in an Israeli Army ‘situation update’ advised that Israel was *“imposing a complete siege on Gaza. No electricity, no food, no water, no fuel. Everything is closed. We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.”* He also informed troops on the Gaza border that he had *“released all the restraints”*, stating in terms that: *“Gaza won’t return to what it was before. We will eliminate everything. If it doesn’t take one day, it will take a week. It will take weeks or even months, we will reach all places.”* He further announced that Israel was moving to “a full-scale response” and that he had “removed every restriction” on Israeli forces.
> 
> * — **Israeli Minister of Finance:** On 8 October 2023, Bezalel Smotrich stated at a meeting of the Israeli Cabinet that *“[w]e need to deal a blow that hasn’t been seen in 50 years and take down Gaza.”*
> 
> * — **Israeli Minister of Energy and Infrastructure:** ‘Tweeting’ on 13 October 2023, Israel Katz stated: *“All the civilian population in Gaza is ordered to leave immediately. We will win. They will not receive a drop of water or a single battery until they leave the world.”*",1204,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/18yer8w/us_rebukes_south_africa_for_meritless_genocide/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/18yer8w/us_rebukes_south_africa_for_meritless_genocide/kga94es

Serious question please, how was Siniora viewed in Lebanon?

I see he's constantly quoted like this exert:

Siniora has continued to criticise Hezbollah's influence in Lebanon, saying that ""Practically, Lebanon as a state has been kidnapped by Hezbollah. And behind Hezbollah is Iran"". In 2024, he opposed Lebanon being dragged into the war in Gaza, saying that the country ""cannot afford, in principle, to get involved"".

So does this mean his ""future movement"" is actively not getting involved or are they behind the scenes supporting Mossad intelligence?",19,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1g2nyfa/hezbollah_hijacked_lebanon_started_the_war_with/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1g2nyfa/hezbollah_hijacked_lebanon_started_the_war_with/lrpkmfo

Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on Sunday he had ordered his ministry to start legal proceedings against French President Emmanuel Macron after Paris banned Israeli firms from participating in an upcoming military naval trade show.

The decision to bar Israeli firms is the latest incident in a row fueled by the Macron government's unease over Israel's conduct in the wars in Gaza and Lebanon.

Euronaval, organizer of the Nov. 4-7 event in Paris, said in a statement last week that the French government had informed it that Israeli delegations were not allowed to exhibit stands or show equipment, but could attend the trade show. The decision affected seven firms, it said.

""I have instructed the Foreign Ministry to take legal and diplomatic action against French President ... decision to prevent Israeli companies from showcasing their products at the @SalonEuronaval exhibition in Paris next month,"" Katz said in a statement on social platform X.

""The boycott of Israeli companies for the second time, or the imposition of unacceptable conditions, are undemocratic measures that are not acceptable between friendly nations.

How do we go about it? 


As someone who been here on 7.10 in my kibbutz near the fence, I can't look at our relationship with Palestinians the same. It's not about hating some ethnic group, it's just that people I worked with were collecting intel for hamas about our homes and where each family lives and who to target.

Personally, I think the US should cut off ALL funding and military aid to Israel. I'm all for Israel defending itself and it's right to exist, but if Bibi and his ultra-nationalists want to play like they're ""Russia in Gaza"", they can do it without US aid. They're big boys, they can make their own way in the world. Give the support to Ukraine where the money goes directly to helping Ukrainians survive. (Plus, Ukraine *appreciates* the help the US provides,... Israel just takes what we give them and thumbs their nose at us.) 

Also, that expensive carrier group should consider moving out of the area. That thing is costly,...

I have no skin in the game ethnically or religiously speaking. I don't hate Muslims or Jews and take each person for who they are. I also have a lot of sympathy for people on either side who are sick and tired of the killing and just want to live peaceful lives out from under the constant threat of death, violence and starvation. 

For most all of my life I've been on Israel's side because I think everyone has a right to exist, but not to the point where I support them committing human rights abuses. That's not an ally I want to help pay for.

A pause gives Hamas time to reorganize and prepare for fighting to start again. A pause sets a precedent that Israel can be pressured to stop by foreign powers. A pause brings everyone who was relocated to South Gaza back north again. 

There is no advantage to a pause for Israel, and even with the return of the hostages it is a terrible proposition because you are hitting the brakes and giving back a significant chunk of the progress that was made whether in land or momentum. 

Israel is finally on the ground in Gaza. Finally there is a way to document everything that is going on firsthand and begin to have a fight in the battle for public perception. If people don't want to pay attention to aerial views showing that Hamas is firing out of hospital windows, maybe they will take GoPro footage of innocent civilians being used as human shields more seriously. 

This is not a time to stop or have any sort of humanitarian pause.

In middle eastern geopolitics, this is how diplomacy is done. The powers in the region can't back down because that will show weakness, but they're also too proud and ideologically driven to have normal diplomatic ties. This is the alternative. They keep exchanging tit for tats, and adjust the scale and intensity based on the circumstances. 

In this case, after Israel bulldozed Iran's crown proxy in Hezbollah (specifically Nasrallah), Iran felt like they needed to strike back to maintain their credibility to their allies. However, they also don't want to escalate things to a war because that'll end badly for them since they're no match for the American led coalition in the region. So instead, they decided to launch a flashy barrage of empty missles that make a lot of good noise for PR but actually do little damage. 

This way Iran can pretend that it bested Israel while simultaneously signaling that they don't want things to escalate. This isn't new. We've already seen Iran do this when Soleimani was killed and again when Haniyeh was killed. This time doesn't seem any different. 

The key here is that Biden managed to successfully convince Israel to not escalate further, at least on paper. Israel's retaliation is going to be smaller than the barrage of missles that Iran launched, and Iran's response to this will likely be even smaller, and they'll continue launching smaller and smaller retaliatory strikes until they go back to the status quo.

This is truly deescalation by escalation",16,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1g3y26o/netanyahu_tells_us_that_israel_will_strike/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1g3y26o/netanyahu_tells_us_that_israel_will_strike/lrzml9o

Where else in the world does a country have to put up with rocket launches like this? 

We have normalized it in Israel because of the Iron Dome which stops the vast majority of rockets, so we don’t see the bodies but threats are always there. If this was happening to any other country, the rest of the world would be up in arms and there would be a coalition to take out the terrorists. Just wild to me how Israel is under constant barrage and they just have to deal with it as a fact of life. Like, new homes and offices must come with bunkers and shelters. That’s fucking insane to me. I guess it’s also insane to me how civilians in that region just have to deal with psychotic terrorists who use them as human shields while they launch rockets from schools and hospitals. 

Whole thing is fucked and it’s not going to end anytime soon. Any ceasefire will last for a period of time and then an attack or bombing will happen and we will all be back to square one blaming both sides for whatever best supports our view of the conflict.

> The channel claimed that several shells were intercepted near Hmeimim, the location of a Russian air base.

> While Russia&#039;s air defense systems have yet to kinetically engage Israeli, Turkish, or Western aircraft and missiles in Syrian airspace, they have provided targeting data to Syrian forces, thereby enhancing Syrian air defense operations.

> While Russian fighter jets such as the Su-34 and Su-35 have conducted intercept missions, including notable instances in 2019 when Su-35s intercepted Israeli jets to prevent attacks on Syrian targets, the broader Russian strategy has relied heavily on its layered air defense network.

Israel does not fool itself into believing it can change the Iranian regime unilaterally.  It can degrade Iranian capability to project power to Israel’s borders.

Nor does Israel particularly care about Iranian supplies to Russia in support of its Ukraine adventure (so long as Russia is not supplying nuclear or other tech in exchange). 

Of course, if Israel were to believe Iran was truly close to obtaining deliverable nuclear capability it would strike first no matter the cost or timing.  This has been Israeli policy for decades.  Todays action suggest the Israelis do not see an imminent nuclear threat from Iran, and we have to assume they know Iran’s capabilities better than the Ayatollah himself.

2024-08-07 11:11:45,worldnews,Israel,1em5w6x,lgx630p,"U.K., U.S. ambassadors to skip Nagasaki peace ceremony as the city did not invite Israel","Julia Longbottom, the British Ambassador to Japan, stated that she would not attend because the exclusion of Israel could send a misleading message, equating Israel with Russia and Belarus, which were also not invited due to their roles in the Ukraine conflict.

Longbottom emphasized that Israel's actions are seen as self-defense, unlike the aggressive actions of Russia and Belarus.

Rahm Emanuel, the US Ambassador to Japan, echoed similar sentiments, expressing that he did not want to support what he viewed as the politicization of the event by excluding Israel.

Emanuel will instead attend a separate event in Tokyo.

Nagasaki's mayor, Shiro Suzuki, explained that the decision not to invite Israel was based on security concerns and the desire to maintain a peaceful and somber atmosphere during the ceremony.

Despite these explanations, the decision has been criticized by various quarters, including the Israeli ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, who attended the Hiroshima peace ceremony earlier this week.

The exclusion of Israel has led to a broader diplomatic fallout, with other Western countries such as Australia, Italy, Canada, and the European Union also indicating lower-level representation at the Nagasaki ceremony.
Critics argue that inviting countries with significant human rights violations while excluding Israel sends a conflicting message about the event's commitment to global peace and unity.",796,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1em5w6x/uk_us_ambassadors_to_skip_nagasaki_peace_ceremony/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1em5w6x/uk_us_ambassadors_to_skip_nagasaki_peace_ceremony/lgx630p

2024-10-09 02:25:48,worldnews,Israel,1fzh7qn,lr1a2iw,Pierre Poilievre says Israel preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons would be a ‘gift’ to humanity,"From the article:

OTTAWA — Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says it would be a “gift” for Israel to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, a statement he made when asked about American opposition to an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear sites.

Outside the House of Commons on Tuesday, Poilievre sidestepped a question about whether an Israeli strike against nuclear facilities in Iran could lead to a direct war between the adversaries. U.S. President Joe Biden, who like Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has urged restraint to prevent the conflict from intensifying further, [told reporters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/biden-says-he-does-not-support-attack-irans-nuclear-sites-2024-10-02/) last week that he does not support an attack on Iran’s nuclear sites. 

Poilievre, however, said Tuesday it would be “the most dangerous and irresponsible thing in the world” to allow Iran — an authoritarian regime that views Israel as illegitimate — to use those facilities to acquire nuclear weapons. 

“If Israel were to stop that genocidal, theocratic, unstable government from acquiring nuclear weapons, it would be a gift by the Jewish state to humanity,” the Conservative leader said. 

Poilievre made the statement moments after he was reprimanded in the House of Commons for claiming, one day earlier, that Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly was pandering to supporters of Hamas, the group Canada deems a terrorist entity that launched the assaults on Oct. 7, 2023 in which more than 1,200 people in Israel were killed and roughly 250 taken hostage. 

On Monday, Poilievre told a Jewish memorial event that Israel should have the right to “proactively” strike Iranian nuclear sites in order to defend itself.",42,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1fzh7qn/pierre_poilievre_says_israel_preventing_iran_from/,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1fzh7qn/pierre_poilievre_says_israel_preventing_iran_from/lr1a2iw

After all the crap the people of Lebanon have had to put up with (corrupt feckless government, Beirut explosion, loss of Ukrainian food imports, economic collapse … the list goes on), having Israel flatten their city for something Hezbollah does would be an unearned catastrophe of the highest order. 

Though in my view, this situation is just more of Hezbollah attacks kept up in order to demonstrate they support Hamas, but kept deliberately limited so as to avoid triggering Israel into attempting to wipe them out. 

Hezbollah lobs the occasional rocket or mortar shell; Israel attempts to play whack-a-mole with Hezbollah artillery or rocket squads. The purpose is so that Hezbollah can loudly proclaim they are supporting a “northern front” without actually risking very much.
