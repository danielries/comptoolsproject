People usually use “proportionality” to mean a commensurate number of civilian deaths.  On this reading, the war in Gaza should have ended when the 1200th Gazan civilian was killed.  But in international humanitarian law, proportionality means something very different:  that any collateral damage should be justified by the expected military benefit of a strike.

2024-05-29 20:35:59,Israel,Palestine,1d3lcb2,l687wbg,Genuine questions from a member of the pro-Palestine side,"1. Fake news. There is no ""safe zone"", there is a ""humanitarian zone"" from which Hamas has been firing rockets since October. The strike on Sunday wasn't in that zone. The fire was caused by Hamas munitions stationed near those tents and the number of casualties has been exageratted. What wouldn't matter is if all hamasniks disappeared in one shot, i.e. 40k+ people, because people would still be crying ""genocide"". The argument of ""creating resentment"" is nonsensical. You can't fight wars without ""creating resentment."" As for whatever it is that you think Israel has been doing for 75 years, stop and think for a moment about all the things Arabs have done in that time.
2. This is literally all fake news. White phosphorous is legal and hasn't been used against civilians. There is more food going into Gaza now than before the war despite a large chunk of Israelis opposing it. What do you think happened on October 7 and before? They murdered infants, children, civilians, not as ""collateral damage"" but ON PURPOSE. If the US was attacked like Israel, it would respond in a far more deadly manner.
3. Sure there are innocents that die, mainly because Hamas is using them as civilian shields. Did the allies kill innocents during WW2? Sure. Whose fault was it? The Axis. And yes the reason does matter, it is not murder. ""Completely unrelated to you"": it is not completely unrelated, Hamas is the government of Gaza and has full support from the population when it comes to attacking Israel. 
4. No, it's not wrong. Human shields cannot be used to prevent a country from fighting a defensive war. The analogy is flawed. Israel already sacrifices many soldiers on the ground to prevent as many human shields from dying as possible. 
5. Hamas won't release all hostages even if Israel ended the war today. The IDF is taking all measures that it can to avoid harm to the hostages. Despite this, some harm may come to them and likely has. This is a very difficult situation, more than you can understand. 
6. Have you questioned the right of any other country to exist? The concept of ""Original sin"" is nonsensical (and is yet another example of a Jewish element being distorted and used against Jews). Hundreds of thousands of Arabs didn't live in the Land of Israel for centuries. Arafat was half-Egyptian and born in Egypt. The displacement occurred after the Arabs launched a genocidal war and lost. The nakba - catastrophe in Arabic (named to take attention away from the Shoah - catastrophe in Hebrew) - was the catastrophe of the Arabs losing land to Jews, and only later has become about the descendants of refugees to fit into a humanitarian narrative.
7. No that is your goal. Israel's goal is to protect its citizens. Yes it's right for independent organs within the IDF to investigate themselves. It's not right for international courts who have no jurisdiction being politically weaponized to fight Israel and help Hamas.
8. Your tax dollars are also funding terrorists. Your tax dollars were funding the Saudis when they fought the Houthis.",701,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1d3lcb2/genuine_questions_from_a_member_of_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1d3lcb2/genuine_questions_from_a_member_of_the/l687wbg
2024-05-29 23:21:39,Israel,Palestine,1d3lcb2,l68yrmi,Genuine questions from a member of the pro-Palestine side,"Thank you for promoting a good-faith dialogue between the two sides. It is unfortunate that you get downvoted, in classic reddit fashion, just because people in this subreddit have a different opinion than you. 

Don’t get me wrong - I disagree with almost every conclusion that you make in your post. I do however recognize that your questions make sense from a pro-palestinian POV. Also, I feel that others here have given a good answer on the Israeli perspective, and will therefore not answer your questions myself. 

Instead, I would like to point out the biggest obstacle to peace in the region from an Israeli POV - the arabs’ accepting, sometimes even celebrating attitude toward violence against Israelis. Let me explain why this is so significant. 

Pretend that you’re an Israeli Jew. This means that you are very much aware of the history of your people. Ever since the Jews lost their own state, when the Hasmonean dynasty fell over 2000 years ago, Jews have not been masters of their own fate. This has resulted in countless of pogroms and exterminations. Thus, every Jew is painfully aware of the consequences of not having your own state. I strongly recommend that you read this [wikipedia article](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Jews), if you wish to understand the foundations of this fear. Do this before reading the following paragraphs, if you want to read them like an Israeli. 

These persecutions occured in every place that Jews have lived. They have been commited by Christians, Muslims, and Pagans alike.

After the holocaust, the christian world has confronted its antisemitism, largely marginalizing the phenomenon. Pagans barely exist anymore. Muslims, however, have never questioned their anti-Jewish sentiments in the same way. This means that most muslims do not recognize the need of a Jewish state. 

Instead, many muslims feel the opposite, that there should not be a Jewish state whatsoever. This attitude has existed since before Israel’s creation, which the arabs opposed in any shape or form. Thus, the muslim hatred towards Israel has little to do with events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The hatred toward Israel is unconditional and ideological. 

When Israelis are killed by Palestinian groups who seek to exterminate the state of Israel, it is almost never condemned by muslim leaders. This solidifies what many Jews believe, that despite agreements and peace deals, deep inside, the arabs want Israel gone. This makes it very difficult for Jews to accept concessions. 

The October 7 attack is the most painful example of this. Only one muslim leader has condemned the acts of Hamas, the king of Bahrain. Others have been silent, and some, like Erdogan, have even praised the group. This is even worse among palestinians, with polls showing a roaring support for Hamas. 

As a Jewish Israeli, making concessions becomes nearly impossible when the other side celebrates when you are killed, and seeks to eliminate you from the map. What will happen if the Palestinians get their own state? Will its people accept coexistence with Israel?

As of today, the answer is no. If Palestine was created tomorrow, Hamas would take over immediatley. This is what happened in Gaza when Israel left in 2005. If the same thing was to happen in the west bank, Israel’s very existance would be threatend. This is what every Jew is scared of. We know what will happen to us if we lose our only state. 

If a day comes, in which Palestinians would abandon their violent ways, peace would be so much simpler. If coexistence was the ambition of the palestinian people - we could have a two state solution tomorrow. However, no Israeli feels that this is the case. We all remember the celebrations after october 7. 

These celebrations hurt the prospects of peace in the middle east. Make us believe that you want peace. Condemn violence. Don’t celebrate it. As long as you keep doing it, Israelis will not want to create a Palestinian state. 

Your promotion of dialogue is the constructive approach that is so necessary, but also so rare. Keep doing what you’re doing, and maybe we shall have peace between our people one day.

2024-05-29 21:49:06,Israel,Palestine,1d3lcb2,l68k941,Genuine questions from a member of the pro-Palestine side,"“Whether Israel has a right to exist” is not “besides the question” - it is literally the root of all of your questions. If you don’t believe that Israel has a right to exist then how on earth could you believe that Israel has a right to defend itself - the point of the whole war? 

I believe you are asking these questions in good faith but I would just like for you to reflect for a moment on how absurd and unique it is that Israel’s right to exist is a considered an open question. Do you think England has a right to exist? What about China? Or any other country on the planet? No other country on earth is deligimatized to the extent that Israel is. You imply the source of this delegitimization is the foundational sin of displacement of Palestinians. Was the displacement fair to the Palestinians? No. Was it justified? Absolutely. The Jewish people were exiled from the land of Israel 2000 years ago and since then have been the most widely persecuted and hated group across the planet. The source of our persecution was the fact that we were a minority everywhere we went - perpetually unable to defend ourselves against the majority. After 2000 years of statelessness the Jewish people collectively decided we’d had enough and returned to our cultural homeland - the land of Israel. In the 48 and 67 wars many  Palestinians were exiled, although many fled willingly as the Arab armies and Israeli fought. It’s not popular to admit but out of the great tragedies of the 20th century the Palestinian nakba is not in the top 50. 750k Palestinians fled or were exiled from Palestine. That’s terrible. But why weren’t they welcomed by the Arab countries which they fled to? The Palestinians are culturally, ethnically, linguistically, and religiously indistinguishable from other Levantine Arabs. Why weren’t they absorbed? Because the Arab countries knew that would alleviate the issue. By keeping the Palestinians as perpetual refugees (the only kind in the world, look up the uniqueness of UNWRA) the Arab countries perpetuate their suffering and their hope of reclaiming the land of Israel - the source of ALL conflicts between the Arabs, Palestinians, and Israel. 

In 1948 the Levantine Arabs and the Israelis should have swapped 750k Palestinians Arabs for the 850k - 1 million Mizrachi and Sephardic Jews living in Arab lands (all of whom would be exiled or flee due to persecution over the next 30 years). If this sounds impossible Turkey and Greece did a population swap of a larger scale in the 1920s.",304,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1d3lcb2/genuine_questions_from_a_member_of_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1d3lcb2/genuine_questions_from_a_member_of_the/l68k941

Without an Israeli response to october 7th, Hamas has found the perfect crime. The world is setting a dangerous precedent in which a democratic country can be attacked brutally and cannot hunt down the terror organization that did that.

2024-05-29 23:08:32,Israel,Palestine,1d3lcb2,l68ws9m,Genuine questions from a member of the pro-Palestine side,"This question may be in good faith but there are so many incorrect premises in them that it is like talking to someone from another planet. Which is, not coincidentally, the experience Jews everywhere are feeling right now as they wonder what happened to the world that made everyone decide the Islamist narrative is correct.

I'm going to ask you some questions as well because it sure would be nice to understand your point of view.

1. In the history of humanity, has there ever been a ""just war"" ? One where you could point to one side and say ""the deaths of innocents are awful, but in the end the world was a better place"" ? 
2. Hamas has promised to commit a 10/7 attack ""again and again and again."" Do you believe them? 
3. Do you believe that there is any action that was justified by Israel in response to the terror attack? If so, what would it have to look like for you to NOT consider it ""genocide""? 
4. The vast majority of Jews came to Israel (formerly Mandatory Palestine under the British, formerly a part of the Ottoman empire) to escape persecution. Often they were forced to surrender all their possessions in order to leave. This started in earnest after the May laws in the Pale of Settlement in the late 1890s and led to the much larger Jewish population present in Israel by 1948. Holocaust survivors also chose to move to Israel rather than return to countries where they had originally been from and were no longer wanted. They arrived in numbers that no other country would accept. What should they have done instead? 
5. During wars, people become refugees. Often there is not an option to return to their original homes. They require resettlement in order to begin to live proper lives. The UNHCR, an organization of 20,000 employees, takes responsibility for resettling / repatriating these refugees into other countries. Yet for 75 years, Palestinians remain refugees, and their refugee status is passed down to their descendants. A dedicated organization (UNRWA) of 30,000 employees has been responsible for providing them aid since 1949, but has no mandate to resettle them. Why is this arrangement in place? Why doesn't every displaced people have their own dedicated relief organization?
6. 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from Israel between 1947 and 1948, In the following decades, Arab countries in the Middle East violently expelled 950,000 Jews. Israel took those Jews in willingly, and the majority of Jews in Israel today are they and their descendants. Do Palestinians have options for other places to live? If not, why not? Does Israel bear more responsibility for Palestinians than the other nations do for Jews? Why?
7. Is Israel a legitimate country? Is your country legitimate? If the answer to these two questions is not the same, why? If your answer to both is ""no,"" why do you still live where you do, and what is your responsibility toward the people your very presence displaces? 
8. Why has antisemitism increased globally since 10/7?",268,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1d3lcb2/genuine_questions_from_a_member_of_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1d3lcb2/genuine_questions_from_a_member_of_the/l68ws9m
2024-05-29 20:29:54,Israel,Palestine,1d3lcb2,l686unw,Genuine questions from a member of the pro-Palestine side,"I'm sorry you're getting downvoted. You DO seem to be engaging in good faith, although I think we've all heard these talking points so many times that we are utterly exhausted with them, especially since we've been hearing them from a lot of people who ARE genuinely antisemitic, or at least from people who have adopted positions from people who aren't acting in good faith.

I have to go to work soon, so I don't have time to answer all of this. I think a lot of the points rely on false premises, to be honest, or a distorted view of what is happening. I'll pick some to start answering now, though:

4. Comparing the enemy's use of its own people as shields in a war to a criminal's use of citizens as shields during a crime isn't really fair. In a domestic hostage situation, the police's DUTY is to resolve the situation while protecting the civilians. Police exist to protect EVERYONE, and harming people should be a last resort for them if their own lives are threatened. In a time of war, the duty primary of the military is to protect ITS OWN civilians while attempting to achieve strategic goals. It should not attack the enemy's civilians for the purpose of killing them, nor should it engage in other actions that don't further legitimate strategic aims, but it also cannot allow the enemy to prevent it from achieving legitimate strategic goals by using its own civilians as shields. 

2. Israel has millions of people. If it faces an existential threat that could lead to those people being killed or enslaved under Islamist rule, then military action that results in thousands of dead civilians IS justified, as long as Israel isn't intentionally targeting civilians for the purpose of killing them. According to some recent research, it would seem that plenty of aid has been allowed in by Israel, and the primary problem is that Hamas goes out of its way to either steal the aid or prevent people from accessing it. I DO believe that the IDF is justified in stopping aid in areas where there's a high likelihood that it would be seized by Hamas to feed its troops, though.

>Specifically, the Israeli researchers found that on average, between January and April, 124 trucks carrying food and humanitarian aid entered Gaza per day. That adds up to 3,211 calories worth of nutrition per Gazan, per day. The World Health Organization [standard](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234938/#:~:text=These%20values%20are%20a%20blend,women%2C%20it%20is%202%2C200%20kcal.) for calorie consumption is 2,900 per day for average-sized men and 2,200 per day for average-sized women.

2024-05-29 22:42:07,Israel,Palestine,1d3lcb2,l68spnx,Genuine questions from a member of the pro-Palestine side,"I largely agree with the answers provided by the “weary” but also have a couple of questions for you.

Hamas openly declared in its founding charter that it wants to exterminate Jews. Hamas leadership also stated that they don’t intend to stop at Israel and that once its destroyed they plan to take over the world and install Islamic Caliphate and Sharia.   Hamas demonstrated increasing capacity to mass murder Jews in a very deliberate campaign of invasion, rape and mass murder of children, women and others. And committed to doing it again and again and again.  

Yes, eliminating Hamas in a densely populated area involves civilian casualties.  Particularly so, that Hamas and other terrorist groups embed themselves in hospitals, schools, mosques, etc and place missiles next to tents with civilians as soon as humanitarian zones are declared.

Given the above, what choice does Israel have? What would you do? Don’t you think that Israel’s government has an obligation to defend her citizens from rapie mass murderers committed to extermination of Jews?  What about the US government? American Jews are US citizens.  They are the declared target of Hamas.  Isn’t the US obliged to eliminate the terrorist threat successfully targeting US citizens (several held and tortured by Hamas as you typed your questions)?",93,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1d3lcb2/genuine_questions_from_a_member_of_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1d3lcb2/genuine_questions_from_a_member_of_the/l68spnx
2024-05-29 23:21:19,Israel,Palestine,1d3lcb2,l68yptz,Genuine questions from a member of the pro-Palestine side,"Thanks for your questions, if I may ask a few concrete questions to try to reframe the conversation.

As you say, you are pro-Palestinian, and your questions make you seem like your top priority is the safety of of innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza. If this is indeed the case, shouldn't your main ask of the situation be that Hamas resign/surrender, stop using human shields, and give back all hostages? Do you agree that if that were to happen, the current war/aggression would stop? 

Do you agree that Hamas have killed, and continue to kill, Palestinians through human shields, those who they deem to be dissenters, etc.? Do you agree that Hamas has killed members the Palestinian Authority and the PLO? Do you agree that Hamas is generally bad for the Palestinian cause? 

If your main concern is that so many innocent Palestinians are dying in this war, should your cause not be to get Hamas to end the war by way of steps I've given above? Israel wants Hamas defeated and their hostages back. There seems to be a very simple solution to end the suffering. Do you support that solution? If so, why do you not protest agains Hamas? If not, why not?",76,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1d3lcb2/genuine_questions_from_a_member_of_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1d3lcb2/genuine_questions_from_a_member_of_the/l68yptz
2024-05-29 21:01:23,Israel,Palestine,1d3lcb2,l68ca49,Genuine questions from a member of the pro-Palestine side,"I’m pretty sure everyone here will have a few interesting rhetorics about the points you made, but I’ll be very simple on my opinion : 

Israel answered brutally to 10/7. Given the situation in the enclave, it’s nearly impossible to be a safe civilian between IDF and Hamas (Hamas will do nothing to protect their own and even stated it was unwra’s job to take care of the Palestinian suffering, they do not care)

Now, about Israel, I will keep defending this country’s existence for the simple fact that so many of you (propal) want it gone. 

For me, it’s not about the war, the suffering, it’s about making sure I’m not giving an inch to anyone who wants to destroy this country. 

War crimes, famine, targeting of civilians. All of this is despicable if proven to be true (and some of it is certainly true) but still I will not stop supporting the existence of this country and its people. If the world and Palestinians stop threatening Israel existence, there is no reason to let this war continue and I will be on the side of peace. As long as y’all praise « river to the sea » and « intifada », I’m with Israel and the Jewish community to do whatever it takes to annihilate that threat.",55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1d3lcb2/genuine_questions_from_a_member_of_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1d3lcb2/genuine_questions_from_a_member_of_the/l68ca49
2024-05-29 21:31:54,Israel,Palestine,1d3lcb2,l68hell,Genuine questions from a member of the pro-Palestine side,"4. Because if we let terrorists get away with using human shields then eventually we will all be human shields. Moreover, Israel literally does everything in their power and more than any other military to avoid civilian casualties hence the extraordinarily low combatant to civilian death ratio in this war being fought in a highly urban environment with HUMAN SHIELDS. Which are the problem. 

5. Israel sadly doesn’t have the luxury to only retrieve their stolen loved ones but has to worry about the thousands of rockets being fired into Israel by Hamas, and Hamas continuing to repeat Oct 7 again and again as they vowed so they must balance the two issues. You have no idea the depth of the tragedy of that balancing act and frankly you should really humble yourself. Do not presume to care more about Israeli hostages than Israelis themselves. That is audaciously self unaware and arrogant and presumptuous and wrong on every level. 

6. Arabs were displaced by their own genocidal war toward the new state Israel. They rejected the partition that the Jews accepted that would have left everyone in their homes with literally no displacement. Once 5 Arab armies went to war with the beleaguered Jewish people who were still reeling from the Holocaust displacement naturally occurred. How about you worry about the 7 million Hindu displaced when Pakistan was created the same year. Also look up the Peel commission.  

7. You are speaking to Jews and Israelis mostly on this thread do not lecture us as if we haven’t been beaten over the head with these exact arguments for our entire lives. Humble yourself. IDF’s clear agenda is to protect Israel and Israelis. You have shown yourself to have a woefully uninformed view of this conflict so worry about your own edification before you worry about our lived experiences. 

8. Frankly, you are not in a position to accurately diagnose why this conflict has blown up. You don’t even know the very first thing about antisemitism and how to recognize it let alone how to not engage in it so how could you possibly diagnose or understand how it is animating this conflict. You don’t know about the Middle East. You simply just don’t understand this conflict well enough to tell others why things are as they are.

Then add in the fact that these are the children and grandchildren of the people who marched 6 million Jews off to the gas chambers, betrayed their Jewish fellow citizens to German authorities, aided in their capture, turned them away from their borders as they sought refuge, carried on business as usual with Germany, and mined and delivered the iron ore that was used to build the crematoriums and rail way tracks.

On a side note: There has never been an international dispute that the Irish establishment (political, media, and entertainment class) has ever been on the right side of.

Robert Putnam wrote a paper on something called the “two-level game”. In essence, **all foreign policy decisions are primarily driven by domestic demands.** In other words, foreign policy is not unrelated to domestic policy, it is not even an “extension” of domestic policy, foreign policy is domestic policy. The reason is simple— it doesn’t matter how well-liked you are on the global stage, your own citizens can un-elect you. 

**These decisions are to satisfy their domestic audiences.** The average European knows very little about what’s going on in Israel. All they see is “war happened and people died, Israel has better weapons BLAH BLAH BLAH”. Even someone who casually follows the news can’t understand the nuances, not to mention the ones who get their news from social media. This is a complex interdisciplinary issue, and there is no simple way for Israel to solve it.

If enough people object/protest in the democratic/representative public, it becomes harder for those governments to keep the political/diplomatic line they truly need to maintain to stop this global abuse of power by russia, iran and china.

The governments of iran, russia, china, etc know the main way to fight is by causing turmoil in their opponent’s government.  

What you are seeing/noticing as ‘one of the loudest voices’ is part of psychological warfare.  Use the media to fight for your cause and put agents of discord amongst their citizens to push your agenda.  

In warfare, if you can turn the hearts and minds of your opponents citizens, it weakens them.

Firstly, the name ""Palestine"" definitely appears more than just twice in a ""political context."" It's referenced since the 12th-century BCE in Egypt as Peleset in [temple memorials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medinet_Habu) and [statues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padiiset%27s_Statue). It also appears in [Esarhaddon's Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esarhaddon%27s_Treaty_with_Ba%27al_of_Tyre) in 900 BCE. It's subsequently [mentioned countless times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_name_Palestine) by basically every group that every administered the region, under various cognates of the same name.

Also as some are saying in the comments, the etymology for the Greek cognate *Palaistínē* (*Παλαιστίνη*), which is the version most used today, is not ""invaders"", but is a portmanteau of *palaistês*, meaning ""wrestler/rival/adversary"" as a reference to the [etymological name for Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_wrestling_with_the_angel) (""contends/wrestles with God"", referring to Jacob). In other words, it's a [literal translation of the word ""Israel""](https://doi.org/10.2307%2F1357617), which I think is very neat.",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1dvjy6m/palestine_was_the_colonial_name_for_israel_it_is/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1dvjy6m/palestine_was_the_colonial_name_for_israel_it_is/lbpsz3a

Many Israelis are not aware of this, and I’m not saying this as a justification for this recognition but Armenians in Jerusalem have been suffering from Israeli discrimination for years now, and not necessarily only from the ultra-orthodox who spit on us because we are Christians. Our rights in the Armenian quarter of Jerusalem are being violated and the Israeli government is not doing anything to protect us.  

Israel has not recognised the Armenian Genocide despite the fact that out of all countries in the world it should have been the first one to stand with Armenia as Israel had the exact same thing happen to its people. Instead, Israel has been exploiting this issue to get on the nerves of the Turkish government which is incredibly disrespectful to us Armenians.

For years now Israel has been the main supplier of weapons to the Azeri regime which just recently ethnically cleansed Armenians out of a part of our homeland. 

And despite all of this, Armenia, since its independence, has been one of the most Zionist countries in the world and one of the safest places for Jews. Our last president even wrote a book with a heavy focus on Israel and our governments have generally always taken the side of Israel despite the fact that we never got anything in return.

At first they would not object to a 'Palestinian state' on the 67' borders if possible, but it would just start a new chapter for their ''resistance'', they would exploit the lands to maybe launch more 7th of october like invasions into isareli territory, which would be fatal for Israel as a state due to the demographic problem. I completely understand why Israel refuses a ''Palestinian State'' the country's leaders are not dumb, they made a concession in 2005 (ain't sure when exactly, correct me if I'm wrong) and withdrew from gaza (which can be seen as a de-facto Palestinian state), it was a sign of good will from Israel. Guess what happened a year later? A terrorist group named Hamas took control of the strip and declared jihad on Israel, Israel responded by blocading the strip, and despite that many Gazans were working in Israel, they had drinking water supplied, electricity and communication networks.

Most of these are also well-known to people like me who are Zionists and I think it speaks well of Israel as a country where rule of law prevails to acknowledge its own wrongdoings instead of supporting the disappearance of the country.

Actually that massacre might not have been an actual massacre, its quite contested and lacks evidence, while I agree that we should acknowledge wrong doings, they still require evidence, if you wanna acknowledge some Israeli wrong doings, the deir yassin massacre has much more historical consensus that it actually happened rather then the tantuta one.",12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1ew64yz/what_i_find_wrong_with_ilan_pappes_ethnic/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1ew64yz/what_i_find_wrong_with_ilan_pappes_ethnic/lix7c1c

Not because of your final position, but because so few people shake themselves out of group think and take the time to do the homework and critically assess a topic.  

I have no data but my own observations of myself and those I’ve worked with and known over the decades and the things I see in books and history, but I don’t think 1% of people have the skills you exhibited to be an independent and critical thinker who is also capable of acknowledging self mistake and changing your actual opinion. 

The best thing is that once you’ve done it once on a topic, you’ll find it easier to do on new topics and you’ll eventually begin to approach new topics differently from the start.  You’ll start to see red flags and cult like behaviors and group think manifesting in others, and you’ll be quicker and faster at spotting charlatans and liars and false narratives.  You’ll start to ask questions sooner and interrogate narratives faster (but not to fit in) but without fear of being left out.  You’ll care more about the answers than who is offended at the questions. 

Only “downside” is you might feel lonely and realize how out of place you feel when you see how many people are drowning in group think and chasing clout at the price of losing integrity or critical thinking. You’ll realize the majority is not usually right and that to be a critical thinker who can go against the grain will actually set you outside the group dynamic. Extroverts will feel it harder.  Introverts will embrace it. Those in the middle will feel it but I think standing alone to keep your intellectual and emotional integrity is the challenge.  

One that I would never trade.

I have American Jewish friends who were staunchly supportive of a “two-state solution” and very much involved with pro palestine orgs before 10/7, interestingly enough they were often using the argument that defending Israel’s right to simply exist is fuelling *islamophobia* in the US. 

One of them was physically attacked by a mob of pro palestine on my campus, three weeks after 10/7, just because he was identified as Jewish and was near the yard where the pro palestine were holding one of their ridiculous “rise awareness for palestine” bs theatre-like “protest”. A lot of my American Jewish friends are just disheartened to see that the pro palestine are just pro hamas unhinged people, most of them weren’t directly confronted to this type of blatant antisemitism before 10/7 and understood that they were tokenized by the pro palestine groups. There’s a sense of betrayal for a lot of them and honestly I don’t even talk about that with some of them, some of my older American Jewish friends (30+) who were very critical of the Israeli politics are barely talking about the current situation, one of my friend (he was, and still is to some extent, a Bernie bro) told me, just last weekend, that he needs to grasp with some sort of loss of innocence. From what I understand, a lot are caught between their leftist ideals, their American identity and the reality of what happened on and since 10/7.

My French Jewish friends understood that the pro palestine always had ulterior motives and since most of them have roots in MENA countries they were never pro palestine because their families were kicked out of these countries. So the situation is slightly different in France.",88,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1c5ivwl/jewish_friend_supports_palestine/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1c5ivwl/jewish_friend_supports_palestine/kzult32

Jews.  Muslims.  Israelis.  Palestinians.  By definition, that makes me a Zionist, a label I wear proudly.

With respect to who is indigenous, Jews are indigenous to the region, and, based on my lay understanding, so are Palestinians.  Many can (like Jews) trace their DNA and ancestry to cannanite and Israelite tribes.  There is plenty of historical evidence.  I am not an expert, however, and I defer to others with more expertise on Palestinians ancestry.

I have nothing against Palestinians as a people or as individuals.  I hope that we can one day live in peace.  

With respect to the hostages, please use some critical thinking.  Hanas has a known track record of capturing and keeping hostages.  They kept Gilad Shalit for years. They have kept Avera Mengistu since 2014.  (2014!)  Hamas played games with Israel during those negotiations. And now, do you really think that they captured all those hostages to immediately turn around and release them?  Hamas still has over 100 hostages still—one of which just had his first birthday in Hamas captivity.  Many reports coming out about their sexual assaults and beatings in captivity, too.  Israel has offered several deals to try to get its hostages back.  They have not been accepted.  If Hamas wanted to release them, why haven’t they been released?

As for daily life, I no longer live in Israel but my family is still there.  Things are not beautiful and luxurious.  Frequent rocket fire from the north and south.  A government no one likes.  Hundreds of thousands of people displaced because of fighting.  Tens of thousands of people recalled to the military.  Increased tension and paranoia affecting our Israeli-Arab populations (and Israeli-Jewish populations).  And there still being hostages in Gaza.

Palestinians have built a National identity to the land. Jews are indigenous to the land as well. It's not sum zero hence a 2SS is valid. Just like in Canada and the USA different nations of people can have overlapping existence....

2024-01-13 00:07:44,Israel,Palestine,1954f6h,khlj3zg,Questions from a “pro-Palestine Jew”: starting to realize I’m in the wrong,"Hey there fellow Jew!
First off, nothing you've said about your previous 'blind' belief to the Palestinian narrative is stupid.
Humane people of all backgrounds can fall quite easily to this kind of propaganda, which so easily plays into our overly simplistic pattern of thought regarding conflicts - oppressors vs oppressed, powerful vs. underdogs etc.
It should also be mentioned that some aspects of the Palestinian narrative hold some sort of truth -- there's a reason it caught up so well in the Western society;
*""The best lies contain within them nuggets of truth, enough to give a listener pause""* - J.R.R Martin.

To your questions:

>1. Are Palestinian people the native/indigenous people of this land? If not then who is?

The piece of land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea was known throughout history in many names. 
Palestine is the most recent, but even Arabs in the region widely opposed this name up until the 19th century.  
It was considered, throughout history, as the southern part of Syria. The Palestinian national identity only formed in the 1880s, as a direct result of Zionism.
A good example for it would be that from 1948 to 1967, the WB was ruled by Jordan and Gaza by Egypt.
So when you ask about the Palestinian people, you're assuming a coherent Palestinian identity in the first place, which was not the case until very recently (historically speaking).

I will humor this question however; the people that call themselves Palestinians today are indigenous Arabs.
Some of them from the area of the Levant, some from the Sahara, some from the West Bank.
The lifestyle of the past millenia is nomadic, meaning people often didn't stay in the same place for many generations (specifically in this part of the world) - so immigration from one area to another was very common.
It should also be mentioned that many of current Palestinians are direct descendants of Jews that converted to Christianity and later to Islam. 

What indigenous really means? What is the cutoff for length of stay in a land that renders one indigenous? 
It's easy to distinguish Native Americans to be indigenous to America (or Aboriginals to Australia) because it's a continent in which they formed seperate civilizations throught ages.

So, to sum up, this question is a complex ethnogeographic one, and its wording harbors a basic rhetoric fallacy - the question itself is pretty irrelevant considering the nature of the words that form it (indigenous and Palestinian).
I'd say more about why it's so irrelevant in the answer to your next questions, I assume.
Possession of land is very complex and is completely subjective. I do not believe the Arabs have an exclusive right to this land, arguably not even partial right more than the Jews.
*There is not an acre of ground on the globe that is in possession of its rightful owner, or that has not been taken away from owner after owner, cycle afer cycle, by force and bloodshed.* - Mark Twain.

>2. Is it true that Israel refused to take back the hostages?

Hamas has said it will free the hostages when Israel's aggression will stop.
In the scope of this conflict, it means Israel has to completely withdraw from the Gaza Strip, shut down its operation and let Hamas build infrastructure again for the next deadly massacre.
In other terms: it means surrender of Israel to Hamas.
Not one Israeli will go back to live anywhere near Southern Israel if Israel agrees to this deadly deal.

>3. What are your personal feelings about the people of Palestine? Not Hamas or their supporters, but ordinary people who happen to live there.

I was raised to judge people for who they are, and that the value of life is above everything else.
Even though the Palestinian flag is the flag of a terrorist organization that killed hundreds of Israelis, and the Palestinian charther and anthem calls for the eradication of Israel, and that Palestinian leaders endorse and promote killing of Israelis and genocidal agendas -- **I still think Palestinian are good people**.
They are merely the victims of the Arab world, which chooses to help them resist, die and suffer and not to prosper (this is the root of their problem and this conflict, I can explain more on that if you'd want).
Palestinian individuals mostly want to kill or cleanse all Israelis, which makes them quite hard to like, but they often keep their opinions to themselves so it's OK.
I know how deeply indoctrinated they are, and I know how powerful religion can be, so I don't hate them.


>4. This is for people currently in Israel. What has your life been like these past few months? I’ve been told everything is beautiful and luxurious for Israelis.

Israel has 7 million Jews (approx. population of Arizona), condensed in an area smaller than the size of New Jersey.
That means each and every Israeli knows someone (a close relative or a friend) who was either murdered/taken hostage on October 7th or died in the war since then.
Yes, we have running water and food in our fridges.
But we still cry over the loss of 1,200 of our brothers and sisters in a massacre 3 months ago, we still think about our elderly that die in Hamas tunnels with no medical care and hunger, and our girls who are being continously raped by terrorists at this very moment.
We still have 120,000 people internally displaced in the country.
We all have loved ones who are risking their lives in the most dangerous place in world right now, Gaza.
It should also be mentioned that at the same time that we fight in 5 fronts here in Israel, we also face hate from billions of people around the world that truly believe we don't have the right to exist or defend ourselves.
So, no, life in Israel haven't been so beautiful in the past 3 months. It's in fact more like hell on earth for most Israelis, where the death and suffering of our people is present everywhere and everyday. 

>5. What can I personally do, as a student living in North America, to support Israel apart from spreading awareness?

Educate yourself on the topic as much as you can so can could have the informational tools to critically think and refute the murderous pro Palestinian narrative.
Spread awareness about the cruelty of Hamas and why it should cease to exist.
Point out that anti-Zionism is antisemitism, and it can't be labeled as anything else (you can read more online on 'new antisemitism').
If you can make one pro Palestinian see the hypocrisy of their claims, you've done more than most of us here in Israel can do.

Lastly, I'd encourage you to get into this intellectual journey completely unbiased. Let yourself form your own individual and unique opinion, objectively. Try to think as a researcher, not as an American, a Jew, or someone who had previously stood only for the Palestinian cause.
Let yourself ask the hard questions - where was Israel wrong? Where was Palestine wrong? Why were they wrong? Is this source credible enough? What am I missing in the broader context?
A good starting point for this journey would be to try to see the Israeli narrative for each Palestinian narrative you know about - and this way, to find the center; where there's nothing left but the truth, clean of any agendas and propaganda. pro Palestinian sources never show any of the Israeli perspective, which serves the radical hivemind mentality. There are plenty of Israeli scholars, however, that show both sides somehow neutrally.",53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1954f6h/questions_from_a_propalestine_jew_starting_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1954f6h/questions_from_a_propalestine_jew_starting_to/khlj3zg

The Israeli people are the descendants and inheritors of the original levantine population. Referred to as Canaan historically.  There is confirmed archeological evidence dating back to approximately 1500 BCE placing tribes of Israel in the Levant.  Traditional and later written records places the tribes of Israel much earlier.  The kingdom of Israel and Judea, which incorporated modern Israel, Jordan, Syria, and some of Gaza is a historical nation that existed from approximately 1000 BCE to 79 CE.  Which is when Rome leveled Jerusalem, the Temple, and Israel.  The renamed the region Philistea, after the Aegean people that tried and failed to conquer the region centuries before, and turned it into another Roman province.  While a great many Israelites were enslaved, exiled or killed, some were able to remain in Israel, and continued to practice their traditions.  Traditions shared by all exiled Jews.  

The Arab conquest of the region occurred around 600 CE.  They killed or enslaved as much of the population as they could, and tried to convert the rest.  Modern Palestinians are primarily descended culturally and biologically from this group.  

The jewish people have always persisted in this region, even when others have tried to kill or enslave them, they have remained.

2024-01-12 23:51:15,Israel,Palestine,1954f6h,khlgkm1,Questions from a “pro-Palestine Jew”: starting to realize I’m in the wrong,"First, I am going to guess that you live in Canada, probably Montreal or Toronto (correct me if I’m wrong, but the most outrageous things I’ve seen in North America come from there).

I’m going to reply with my experience because I think it’s better for every Jew to make his/her way back to the community in their own way. The only important thing is that you understand that when people tell you that as a Jew you should hide, they are antisemitic. When they don’t even acknowledge that some Jews may have different opinions and cancel them just because of being Jewish, they are antisemitic. And you know, when they come for Jews, no other identity or characteristic matters, that’s what I take away from the Shoah.

I was educated in a very Zionist school founded by Shoah survivors. I felt my education as indoctrination. I thought that they expected us to support Israel uncritically, regardless of the party in power (clearly as I was always left-leaning I found it harder and harder to support Sharon or Netanyahu), because without Israel there would be no Jews.

My mother always told me that Arabs hate us, but as a good rebel I made Arab friends from Syria and Egypt to try. It was all good and rosy until Oct 7 and until I started expressing that “hey my family and friends in Israel could have been killed by Hamas, why are people posting shit about free Palestine or justifying the attacks instead of asking me how my family is doing”. Of course my Arab friends blocked me for simply being Jewish, so I kinda have to give it to my mom.

Anyway, after Oct 7 I realized that, while my education was a bit flawed in that Israel is a country that can make wrong political choices, we need it to exist because the antisemitic bigots are everywhere and I personally don’t want to be harassed or discriminated simply for my ethnicity. So I am happy to know there is a country where my family and I can go to seek refuge.",24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1954f6h/questions_from_a_propalestine_jew_starting_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1954f6h/questions_from_a_propalestine_jew_starting_to/khlgkm1
2024-01-13 00:09:01,Israel,Palestine,1954f6h,khljb2v,Questions from a “pro-Palestine Jew”: starting to realize I’m in the wrong,"1) Jews were always indigenous to this land - genetic tests prove that we are genetically closer to each other and to other levantine peoples, than we are to the people in the countries that we left when immigrating to Israel (because holocaust, pogroms...). Palestinians also have levantine genetics mostly, but there was no such thing as ""Palestinians"" when Israel came to be. There were many unrelated Arab tribes, levantine people that were arabized during Arab colonialism, and a lot of empty land. There were also many Jews still in the land of Israel, many generations before '48, so it's not like these lands were uniquely Arab. The Palestinian identity and nationality was artificially created in the sixties, only to unite the Arabs against the so-called [""evil Zionist entity""](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionist_entity). There are other peoples indigenous to the levantine, for example the Druze - do you see them making any trouble?
2) After Hamas was done releasing children and mothers along with some of the elderly (except for the Bibas family, which they claim are dead, but the IDF says there is no basis to these claims), Hamas was supposed to start releasing the women and the rest of the elderly. They didn't want to release the women, they wanted to release only the elderly + some dead hostages. This is after Hamas broke the ceasefire multiple times and ""played games"" too many times with the hostage deal. Israel said that we're not playing their games anymore and announced the return to war. This didn't break the deal as the ceasefire was temporary and it was always stated that the war will continue after the swap ends. Hamas could lengthen the ceasefire by one day for every 10 more hostages released - the ceasefire was longer than the term of the original agreement.
3) I don't hate Palestinians, I feel bad for them. I hate that it has to be this way. Even those who think that Hamas are good, they have been indoctrinated to believe that from a young age. I do hate Hamas fighters, but more than that, I hate the pro-Palestinian activists like your friends, because they weren't indoctrinated, they always had full access to the true facts, yet they support terrorism. I don't think many of them went into it naively like you, many of them are fully aware of the facts, but choose the wrong side anyway, and silence you when you say anything else.
4) The whole country is still in trauma from the 7/10. Half of the country is in disarray because many were recruited to reserve duty, and their families have to make up for them at home. People were afraid to go out for the first month and a half, but we are starting to go back to some kind of routine. The university semester was delayed by months. Small businesses are closing... But besides the 7/10, yes, Israel is definitely more ""luxurious"" than Gaza. Israel is a normal country, because we use our money to develop. Gaza received tons of money, and it all went into terror tunnels instead of into development and the welfare of the civilians. I'm talking about Millions, maybe even Billions of dollars
5) I really don't know. Speaking up against pro-Palestinian activists may actually be dangerous, there are too many videos of them commiting violence against ""Zionists"" (sometimes Jews who never said a word about Israel)
6) I think watching Israel's defence in the ICJ genocide trial sums up a lot pretty well. But that's just the tip of the iceberg - scroll through this sub, as well as r/palestinian_violence, etc.

2: Israel didn't refuse to take back the hostages. Hamas started playing games with giving them back almost immediately, and refused to give back all of the women. 

Even now, there are 13 women that they are holding hostage. The released hostages speak of sexual abuse, and there is a real fear of the remaining female hostages getting pregnant.. 

3: I think theyre tragically indoctrinated. Its awful that they live under an oppressive regime that brainwashed them. Its horrible that their government steals all their aid money to build tunnels and shoot rockets. That they dig up water pipes for the same purpose.

4:I don't live there right now. I imagine people within rocket distance are anxious and suffering PTSD from hamas's indiscriminate bombing. I know there have been studies of Israeli children specifically in regards to PTSD

5: donating to Zaka or a similar organization would be helpful. The horrors they saw as they were identifying the bodies is unimaginable.

I also started to hate how if anything in the world happened, they'd find a way to make it about Palestine. 2022 was when I went from Hamas apologist to zionist.

And also as a Black American, I sympathize with israel even more after I learned about the historic Jewish solidarity with the Civil rights movement. MLK was a big fan of Israel too.

There's no simple solution. But things can't be allowed to go on as they are.

Their resounding silence of crises and atrocities going on across the world, some for decades is proof enough of that. I saw no such mass protests and passion for the genocide of the Uighurs, Kurds, Assyrians, Sudanese, and many more.

The vast majority of pro Palestinian protesters we have seen these last few months know very little about the realities on the ground for Palestinians nor do they care beyond their TikTok clout. They chant and say things they see on Instagram but have taken very little effort to understand the complex realities here beyond the 2 min videos they watch on TikTok.

Almost all of them talk out their asses with a mix of ignorance, racism and self arrogance to the point that's no different than listening to Fox News defending Trump.

It is all superficial that does nothing to address the actual struggles needed to achieve peace and safety for both Palestinians and Israelis.

There are far more legitimate ways to actually make a difference than superficial stunts and uneducated ravings.

If they really want to make a difference they should work with local Israeli/Palestinian peace groups like Standing Together and Combatants for Peace and others like it that are working to address the complex issues here from the ground up rather than useless feel good stunts that have zero impact.

And there are plenty that can be done from addressing systemic issues to partnering with the organizations here that are fighting to make a difference. The very organizations and people that are going to make a difference in the future here. The very systemic issues at the heart of our fighting.

But that involves challenging the preset narratives that so many in the west have. It involves humanization of people rather than branding everyone with the same paint brush.

But so many are unwilling to learn or they succumb to populist propaganda. And that is why I know so many of them don't actually give a crap about Palestinians but only because it is the popular trend.

The genuine truth of what is required for Palestinian self determination alongside Israeli safety doesn't fit the nice clean and box of a 2 min curated TikTok video or a buzz word protest chant.",19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1b8n7nq/do_you_think_most_college_students_are_just/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1b8n7nq/do_you_think_most_college_students_are_just/ktqkxo9

I keep plugging this podcast, Unapologetic: the Third Narrative, but it's super relevant. The hosts are two Palestinian-Israelis who are ""unapologetically"" Palestinian and anti-Hamas, want a reformed PA, want better governance from Palestinians, want a long lasting durable peace, want to be able to live with Jews. In this particular episode, they talk with two Australian Jews, one of whom is also Israeli. Among other things, they call out people who are advocating for violent Palestinian resistance while safely living in London or Melbourne or wherever. They call out BDS for silencing the voices, voices like theirs, who are actually trying to change the status quo. They call out ""peace"" activists who are promoting the preconditions for another war in 5, 10, 15 years.


The conversation can be uncomfortable because, as the title says, they're unapologetically Palestinian and they have harsh things to say about Israel, but it's worth confronting uncomfortable truths about the past in order to build a better future.


And it's incredibly worthwhile to amplify the Palestinian voices that are trying to replace Hamas and the PA with a more functional, forward thinking, peaceful form of governance. ",76,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1dccc0p/am_i_the_only_one_who_sees_pro_palis_as/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1dccc0p/am_i_the_only_one_who_sees_pro_palis_as/l7x5y11

(http://www.wilf.org/English/2013/08/15/palestinians-accept-existence-jewish-state/):

“On Feb. 18, 1947, British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin, not an ardent Zionist by any stretch of the imagination, addressed the British parliament to explain why the UK was taking “the question of Palestine,” which was in its care, to the United Nations. He opened by saying that “His Majesty’s government has been faced with an irreconcilable conflict of principles.” He then goes on to describe the essence of that conflict: “For the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish state. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.””

Their grievance is not that there isn’t a Palestinian state, but that there is a Jewish one.",30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1dccc0p/am_i_the_only_one_who_sees_pro_palis_as/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1dccc0p/am_i_the_only_one_who_sees_pro_palis_as/l7x9l67

We have offered 2SS over the last 100 years multiple times and they have been rejected over and over again. I have watched afew interviews with Palestinians that people have posted on YouTube about 2SS and every time they just say they don't want it.

So what the future holds I don't know. however if I had to guess is that we will make peace with our neighbors such as Saudi etc down the line (whenever that is, this generation, next one or after).

Islam will have a major shift similar to what happend to Judism and Christianity where the majority will become more secular. we need to remember that Islam only started 1400 years ago compared to Judism 4000 years+ and Christianity 2000 years, also how many people in Europe are just now going athiest but Europe even 200 years ago was very religious.

I think that as time passes the more extremist approach to religion will be under control by a more secular government.

2024-08-08 19:09:42,Israel,Palestine,1en9swy,lh5lcx8,Why I No Longer Support the Two-State Solution for Israel and Palestine:...,"Here's the thing about framing all the discourse around a two-state solution:

The first thing to consider is obviously an actual situation in which we have two states, the state of Israel and a Palestinian state. For it to be any different from the situation we are currently in, the Palestinian state must have full sovereignty over its territory, otherwise we will have done nothing. Call me crazy, but with a proven history of hostility towards Israel, a desire for revenge, the insistence on returning Palestinians to the homes they held in 1948, and a whole myriad of other reasons in the same vein, it's safe to assume that the Palestinians would not be content with just their state and would seek to invade and take territory from Israel. Even if we were to ignore their own desire for the rest of Israel's territory, we cannot ignore Iran's influence on them which would surely result in more hostilities. Since in this scenario the Palestinian state is full sovereign, Israel would not be able to do any of the things we do now to prevent this incursion of foreign influence or amassing of weapons/troops in order to attack Israel. This means that Israel would have to invade the Palestinian state and defeat it in war, and if we would want to prevent further hostilities then we would have to go back to occupying them, bringing us back to square one. There is no way a sovereign Palestinian state with the climate as it is would not result in a catastrophe. If Palestinians would choose to make peace, abandon any notion of their own version of the Law of Return, and be willing to invest in their own prosperity instead of in attacking Israel, then we would have something to talk about. Palestinians would prosper, develop, and become a model for how great the Middle East could be, but until then their attitude will remain that of a primitive Middle East that we can see in countries like Egypt or Iraq.

But now to the scary part: what's the alternative? I described what I think would result from a two-state solution (i.e.: it degenerating back to a one-state solution + occupation), but then what's the alternative? Palestinians living in occupation in perpetuity? We as people are conditioned to always look for a solution first, forgetting that some problems simply don't have one. You cannot eliminate poverty or crime, you can only reduce it to a level you deem tolerable. Is the Israel/Palestine conflict one of such cases? To me it's a harrowing thought, looking an entire people in the eye and telling them ""you will live under occupation **forever**"" is depressing, but you simply can't ignore the fact that if you teach to hate your neighbor on an institutional level and refuse to take **any** accountability for past transgressions then there is no deal to talk about. There is nothing they can **say** to convince me that they are serious about running a state, they have to **do**.

In a perfect world we would have two states, each prospering in their own way, having made peace with their past and living in harmonious, jolly cooperation. But we don't live in a perfect world, we live in the Middle East.",22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1en9swy/why_i_no_longer_support_the_twostate_solution_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1en9swy/why_i_no_longer_support_the_twostate_solution_for/lh5lcx8

It's the two state solution or millions of people are going to die, and I wouldn't support Israel during or after this event. I support Israel against Hamas because I believe Hamas are evil. Killing millions of Palestinians is more evil than anything Hamas has ever done, and you'd lose my support and bring shame to Judaism.

On Monday, Hadid, who is Palestinian on her father’s side, posted an image of children with the caption “Gaza on my mind.” However, the image was not from Gaza but from the Yarmouk refugee camp in Syria and was taken from a 2021 documentary during the Syrian civil war.

The misrepresentation prompted Instagram to add a warning that Hadid’s post was “missing context” and could “mislead people.” The note links to a web page that explains the images are from a refugee camp in Syria.

Refaeli then took to Instagram to slam Hadid, sharing a screenshot of the post with the words “fake news” written over the top.

“Didn’t you learn from your sister’s mistake?” she wrote, referring to Gigi Hadid’s own mistake when she posted that Israel is “the only country in the world that keeps children as prisoners of war.”

A very elaborate, well-funded media campaign was deployed to paint Israel as the aggressor after it was attacked and hundreds of Israelis were taken hostage.

Frankly, I’m a bit puzzled on that. I do recall “Islamophobia” being a buzzword around the same time that FGM was making the news rounds in 2014. This matches the Russian tactic of starting discourse among people’s view of refugees, and that may very well be the point of holding these hostages when there’s clearly no political or military advantage in doing so. Why are Western and U.S. media outlets participating in a Russian tactic? I don’t know.

I would love to know if anyone has the english translation to identify his sources for the census data.  Just because he himself didn't go there doesn't mean this information is fake, or made up.

I’ve been a Zionist since I was old enough to start thinking for myself.  My college experience was being argumentative with anti-Zionist classmates and tattling on professors who fostered a hostile atmosphere toward Jewish students.  In graduate school, I became the tokenized Jew and was always assigned Jewish project-topics since I “brought a different perspective”.  Tbh I’m not sure how I feel about that, because I did slap down a lot of anti-Semitic shit in my graduate cohort.

I’ve been a history teacher for the last 15 years or so and I do leverage my popularity with my students to put a favored face on Jews before my students get to college and get exposed to the propaganda and Jewhate.

I’m under the impression that a lot of campus anti-Semitism is the result of the Arab world taking advantage of inroads the Soviets had already made in student leftist groups as the Arabs’ global hegemon shifted from Britain to Russia in the 1950s and 1960s (once it became clear that, although Israel was an anti-colonial project founded by socialists and governed by leftist labor Zionists, it was firmly democratic and west-aligned).",130,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/183wgko/why_american_students_hate_israel_perspective_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/183wgko/why_american_students_hate_israel_perspective_of/karktjw

And I still vote Dem and consider myself left wing btw

I think a lot of the popularity of the pal cause amongst college students has to do with the fact that concepts like colonialism etc are new and shiny, and college students are eager to throw big new words around, especially if they seem “subversive” (see? I used another one!)

Also, at that stage in life many kids feel the need to rebel against their parents’ generation and the establishment/moderate stances.

For me I think the two combined and thats how I wound up at SJP and JVP rallies.

But as I matured I realized the dangers in the stances of antizionists and “apartheid” chanters. I realized how wrong it was, and how truly antisemitic that movement is. I also realized that terrorists really arent another man’s freedom fighter and sometimes people are just wrong.

Relativism and anti-essentialism were new shiny philosophies to me at the time—but I later realized that some things just *are* inherently wrong.

The Israeli Palestinian conflict is a really complex one. You need to understand alot—including colonialism and international law, the history of jews in the middle east generally and their expulsions, the history of jews in europe and zionism, the history of mandates palestine and British empire, the Ottoman Empire, all of Israel’s wars, arab culture and embarrassment about having their asses kicked by Jews, and more. I think that once people do understand all of that there is really no way to side with the Palestinians (and I do mean the palestinians, I dont think their national movement is justifiable if you understand all of the history above). But it takes a lot of learning to get there. Few people do it. And it is very rare that a college student knows about all of that.

2024-05-26 14:12:40,Israel,Palestine,1d10nqb,l5qw7m6,The Israel-Palestine conflict will never end,"You say it’s a fact, but I beg to differ. Back in the 60’s, the common conception was that a recognition of Israel by Arab states was a fool’s dream — they keep attacking us, and outright call for Israel’s destruction. The infamous quote of Nasser “we will drive the Jews to the sea” was echoed throughout the Arab world.

But after the Yom Kippur war, everything changed: Egyptian leadership understood that fighting Israel over and over only to lose time and time again wasn’t going to change anything. Their losses were so massive that they understood that more wars will only weaken them, that it’s a pointless conflict. So eventually, they acquiesced and signed the peace treaty with Israel. This was a momentous event: Egypt is by far the biggest nation in the Arab world, and was the leader of the Arab League at the time. They were the leaders of the anti-Israel camp, and the first to recognize Israel’s legitimacy.

Similarly, Jordan has seen itself as the protectorate of the Palestinian people for many decades. But after the 1st Palestinian intifada (and their king being assassinated by Palestinian terrorists), they also understood that Israel isn’t going anywhere and signed a peace agreement.

The recent Abraham Accords did one better: Arab countries with no borders with Israel saw the potential in having good relations with Israel and signed a peace agreement. The UAE specifically is an amazing case: they were infiltrated by Mossad operatives who committed an assassination in their land  — a national humiliation as they saw it — and they still found it more beneficial to put that aside and come to terms with us, which benefited both Israel and the UAE immensely.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is much more complex and there’s a lot of bad blood between us, certainly. But it’s not unprecedented that seemingly “mortal enemies” of Israel have come to live peacefully with it. I’m not trying to say that it will definitely happen, but there is a chance that it will. These days it might seem like a fairy-tale, but so did a peace agreement with Egypt at the time, and times can and do change. Maybe there’ll come a time when the Palestinians will realize that it’s in their best interest to try and live peacefully with Israel.",96,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1d10nqb/the_israelpalestine_conflict_will_never_end/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1d10nqb/the_israelpalestine_conflict_will_never_end/l5qw7m6

But I also think there’s evidence that Hamas has been running a propaganda campaign in the US since the 90s which has sustained the Western opposition to the peace process in action.

https://extremism.gwu.edu/hamas-networks-america

The encampments, for instance, only served to distract Americans from a ceasefire as Hamas’s position in negotiations was weakening. Egypt and Qatar were alluding negatively to Hamas in the press. And then, the news shifts to these American college protesters, using a lot of Hamas language. The negotiations fell apart, no one paid attention to why, and now they can convince Americans to condemn the Rafah operation. 

I am concerned these networks in America are a large source of Hamas’s power in this conflict, and are potentially being amplified by Russian troll operations targeting key points of discord for American society leading up to the 2024 election. (The protests also overshadowed Trump’s first criminal trial.)

All this to say, as conspiratorial as it sounds, I think we are seeing the climax of a new kind of social media, public opinion-based warfare. I don’t think that it ends well, because it’s largely based in lies. Maybe the truth brings change in areas like Palestinian leadership.

He is actually trying to say that this conflict has nothing to do with religion, and apparently Muslims have always treated Jews just fine. And Israel is a ""white supremacist settler colonial state carrying out expansionist genocide"".

Just erase the entire history of the Mizrahim. Just gaslight people into thinking that the persecution, killing and forced deportation of Jews from *all* Muslim countries just... didn't happen actually. We're all just lying about it so we can kill innocent Muslims. Just gaslight people into thinking that Arabs are native to the Levant, and that they've *never* destroyed our sites of worship.

All those lines in their books, *explicitly telling them to kill Jews*? Nah, never happened. We're just lying.

2024-05-01 20:15:56,Israel,Palestine,1chpnbi,l256u5q,"The Palestine Post newspaper “100,000 Illegal Arab Immigrants”","> In the years 1920-1931 the Moslems and Christians of Palestine were augmented by 100,000 in addition to their natural increase.
>
> This is the conclusion drawn by Mr. A. Reubeni in an article in Monday’s “Doar Hayom”. According to the 1922 census the number of Moslems was 590,000 and Christians 73,024, he writes. The Shaw Commission estimated the number in 1928 of Moslems at 660,000 and Christians 79,000. The number of Moslems in Palestine therefore increased from 1922 to 1928 by 70,000, and Christians by 6,000. According to the census of November 1931, Moslems numbered 769,712, and the Christians 91,398.
>
> **From the beginning of 1928 to the end of 1931 the Moslems thus increased by 100,000 and the Christians by 12,000, that is, 112,000 in three years as compared with 76,000 in the preceding six years.**
>
> What was the cause of this rapid advance? asks Mr. Reubeni. On the basis of the normal natural increase it was to be expected that the Moslems in the years 1929-1931 would increase by at most 39,000 and the Christians by 3,000, together 42,000. How explain the difference between this figure and 112,000, namely an unanticipated 70,000?
>
> As a matter of fact, Mr. Reubeni concludes, the increase up to 1929 is even greater, since it subsequently transpired that the 1922 census on which the Shaw Commission had based its computation, exaggerated the number of Beduin by at least one-third. The Beduin, it has since made clear, numbered then at most 65,000 and not as given, 103,000. So that the Shaw Commission erred by some 40,000 in its estimate for 1928. In fact, therefore, the surplus of Moslems and Christians above their natural increase in the years 1929-1931 was more than 100,000.
>
> **This number represents Moslem and Christian immigrants from neighbouring countries of whom at least 95% are unauthorized. They are Syrians, Lebanese, Hauranites, Iraqis, Trans-Jordanians, Hedjazi, and Egyptians.**

If it's just because you're a Jew, then you're better off not being friends with that kind of person.  


If it's because of different opinions about the war, that's a little more sad.  I try not to argue about the war with my friends, some of whom I know are Palestinian sympathizers today but are generally ignorant about the conflict (or grew up Muslim and have inflexible views).  I don't think everyone calling for a ceasefire is necessarily an evil anti-Semite.  Most of them probably mean well but fall into category of useful idiots, easily swayed by modern social media propaganda.  Some of these friendships can survive the war.  


If you do find that your local society doesn't tolerate your Judaism or views on the conflict, well, that's the purpose of the State of Israel existing.

I was, and am, both pro-Palestine *and* pro-Israel. I view an Israeli life and Palestinian life to be worth the same amount, and I want both people to succeed and thrive. 


However, I used to be in favour of an immediate two-state solution and immediate end to the occupation of the West Bank. I dismissed the “the occupation, system of checkpoints, restrictions on movement, etc… is necessary for security concerns” as an excuse to maintain unjustified control over a besieged Palestinian population. Now I realise that this was an unfair assessment…that, unmonitored and militarised, a Palestinian state with Hamas in power would likely carry out a catastrophic attack on Israel. What brought me to this belief was, post-10/7, the polling that has shown a reliable surge in Palestinian support for Hamas and for the 10/7 attack. This has convinced me that there *is* a meaningful security concern with a two-state solution at the moment, and that deradicalisation *or* demilitarisation such that no 10/7 repeat threat exists must come before a fully autonomous Palestinian state.",157,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1adxu0o/pepole_who_were_previously_pro_palestine_why_did/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1adxu0o/pepole_who_were_previously_pro_palestine_why_did/kk4dov7

especially israels demographic is interesting with its almost 2 million arabs including muslims serving in the IDF

after debating some pro palestinian folks I came to realize that the less you know about this conflict the more likely you are pro palestine

edit: interestingly the propal folks seem to begin the history after the six days war, kind of convenient for them to ignore multiple declared wars on israel with the intent to wipe israel off the map, nevermind decades of suicide attacks and rocket fire, personally I am appaled by the fact that israel was essentially forced by the international community to endure these circumstances, I think you had more than enough patience with these people

On a deeper look,the plan was made in 2002 by Saudi Arabia in order to distance themselves from the 9/11 attacks and to appear more moderate. There are claims that the plan is disingenuous,made knowing it would be turned down and to be used only as a diplomatic stick.

On a practical level,some countries (in the Arab League) will like to make peace or indifferent to it. But some do use Israel as an easy target for their masses to hate and direct blame on issues,domestic,regional, and global.

So, while there is a legal framework that all the Arab League members will make peace with Israel,the situation on the ground may differ. Syria wouldn't make peace until the Golan has been discussed over. Lebanon is meaningless as the government doesn't hold power over military activities. Lybia is in a civil war. Sudan as well. Iraq is an Iranian puppet at this point, so they wouldn't do it.

In summary,Israel might get more countries,especially Africa and Asia,but almost none of the really important countries for security (Syria,Lebanon,Iraq). Israel might get SA and Oman, but in the grander strategic overview,it would have little benefit on that front (outside of the value of supposedly end of military engagement with Palestinian organizations).",28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1ezvowv/hypothetically_if_the_war_ends_and_the_palestine/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1ezvowv/hypothetically_if_the_war_ends_and_the_palestine/ljnww91

Maybe Hezb or ISIS will want to keep fighting, but the actual Arab governments even today don't want war with Israel.  It'll depend a little on geopolitics and internal public pressure on their governments and how well leaders can suppress popular opposition, but I imagine the more west leaning Arab states all normalizing.  

That ain't going to happen, sadly.  Even if Hamas and the PA sign peace with Israel tomorrow we are likely to see attacks by extremists intensify in an effort to derail the peace.

2024-08-23 05:45:00,Israel,Palestine,1ez4vs0,lji4iad,Is this why is it called Palestine and Palestinians? ,"Basically yes that's what happened. The name Judea comes from the time when there was a Kingdom of Yehuda (Judea) and a Kingdom of Israel, but before that, there was the United Monarchy of Israel. So Israel is just a more unifying name, than a name that refers to just one tribe/kingdom. (even if most Jews today descend from either the tribe of Yehuda (To the best of our knowledge) or the tribe of Levi. (Cohen and Levi \[generally\] are both from Levi.)

Now personally, as far as names go, I like the Rudy Rochman solution: You can call it Palestine and I can call it Israel. That's for the people who have a connection to this land. For outsiders, it's probably better to call it Israel when referring to territory that is part of the state of Israel and Palestine when referring to the territory that is part of Palestine. I guess you can adjust with your company but it's probably better not to feed into ""it's all Palestine/Israel"" narratives.

Basically emotionally everyone is entitled to call it what they relate to, but politically it's better to keep a clear demarcation, unless you're advocating for a one-state solution, in which case, just call it Israel/Palestine or Palestine/Israel.

2024-08-23 06:00:48,Israel,Palestine,1ez4vs0,lji64j0,Is this why is it called Palestine and Palestinians? ,"Once Rome fell the Christian Byzantine took over, and later the region was taken by a Muslim empire which eventually switched hands to the Ottomans, so for millennia it was never really up to the people to rename it.

By the time of the British mandate, the Palestine term was considered neutral enough and mostly used by the Jewish population and pro-Zionist movements. Arabs in the region would consider themselves to be either Egyptian, Syrian, Lebanese, or Jordanian. 

Drafters of the Declaration of Independence once considered using Judea as the name of the modern Jewish state (canceled since the Jewish state under the partition plan won't cover the historic Judea) and Palestine as its Arabic name (canceled because it's expected the Arab state will use that name instead)",9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1ez4vs0/is_this_why_is_it_called_palestine_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1ez4vs0/is_this_why_is_it_called_palestine_and/lji64j0
2024-08-23 08:19:32,Israel,Palestine,1ez4vs0,ljij8ub,Is this why is it called Palestine and Palestinians? ,"Short answer: The name Palestine is more ancient than the Roman province of Syria Palestinae by at the very least 6 centuries. The Arabs have used the name Filastin/Palestine for the region since the 7th century CE. There has been a *regional* identity of Arabs in the region of Palestine for many centuries, but the *national* identity of Palestinians as an Arab nationality is relatively new. The confusion about the origin of the naming of Palestinians is based in this (often unknown/misunderstood) historical context. 

Longer answer: The first extrabiblical mention of the name Palestine is from the 5th century BCE in the *Histories* by Herodotus, called *Pilistine* in Greek, where he used this name for the region of the southwestern shore of Mandatory Palestine — roughly corresponding to the area of modern day Gaza, Ashkelon, Ashdod, and some territory inland. This is likely a translation from the ancient Hebrew word פלשת *Peleshet*, mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as well, which denotes the area where the Philistines lived. The meaning of the word *Peleshet* is probably derived from the Hebrew stem פ-ל-ש *P-L-SH*, which is semantically associated with “invasion/invaders”, as the Philistines were related to the Sea People: a people that invaded the Eastern Mediterranean in the 12th century BCE in a period called the Bronze Age Collapse.  The name *Peleshet* is also mentioned in ancient Egyptian (12th century BCE) and Assyrian (8th century BCE) manuscripts as a name for the same region/people, most likely as cognates of the Hebrew word. 

The name Pilistine/Palestina was used by the Greeks and Romans, respectively, long before the province was called Syria Palestinae. However, this name was used to denote a geographic region, and not in any administrative capacity; the area of Pilistine/Palestina was the region where the Philistines once lived, and so was named after them. 

The renaming of the provinces of Judaea (roughly the area of Mandatory Palestine, but without the Negev and with the eastern side of the Jordan river) to Syria Palestinae was carried out as a punishment for the Jews in the 2nd century CE, after the failed Bar Kochba revolt in 132-136. In the 4th century the province was divided into two, and renamed Palestinae Prima (First Palestine) and Palestinae Secundae (Second Palestine), and the area of the Negev and Sinai (that wasn’t a part of Syria Palestinae) was named Palestinae Tertia (Third Palestine). Since then, the common European and Christian name for this region has been, and still remains, Palestine. 

In the 7th century, after the Muslim conquest of the Levant, this region under the Islamic Caliphates was named Jund Filastin (Jund is an Islamic term for a military district, and Filastin is Arabic for Palestine). Since then, a common (although not exclusive) name for the region in the Muslim world has been, and still remains, Filastin/Palestine. After the Muslim conquest, the region has always been under either Christian or Muslim rule: sometimes it was called Syria (or some variation of it), sometimes Palestine (or some variation of it), and sometimes something else (like the Kingdom of Jerusalem). 

The name Palestine is an exonym for the region (or at least began as such): a name used by non-natives for a place or a people; we don’t know how the Philistines called their land. The endonym, i.e. the name used for an area or a people by the natives, for this area (or the area closest to it) is either *Yisrael* — which is the name used by Jews for both the People of Israel (like in *Am Yisrael Chai*), as well as the region itself which is called *Eretz Yisrael*, literally “Land of Israel” — or Canaan, *Kna’an* — which is the name for the region used by the Canaanites/Phoenicians. Jews have never stopped referring to the region of Palestine by its Hebrew name ארץ ישראל *Eretz Yisrael*, often shortened to the acronym א״י. Palestine and *Eretz Yisrael* are literally just 2 names for the same region — not unlike how Germany and Deutschland are 2 names for the same country. 

But, and this is a big but, since neither Canaanites nor Jews have been the majority population in the region for many centuries, and with the region being ruled by many different peoples along the centuries, eventually in the last 1,000+ years the majority of the population in the area have been Arabs, which have become native to the region for all intents and purposes (just to put thing in perspective: Slavs have migrated to the Balkans in roughly the same time the Arabs conquered the Levant). Although the Arabs in the region didn’t see themselves as having a distinct *national* identity until relatively recently (last ~100 years), they did have a distinct *regional* identity for a long time and they did often call this area Filastin/Palestine. Thus, the name Palestine has come to be recognized with the Arabs that live in the region of Palestine. 

There have been Arabs, as well as non-Arabs, that have called themselves Palestinians (or “of Palestine”) before the last 100 years — but this naming was used to denote *regional origin*, rather than *national affiliation*; there have been Palestinian Arabs — as in Arabs of Palestine— for a long time, but the Palestinians as a *nationality* are relatively new. The reason the Palestinians call themselves Palestinians is because Arabs living in this region, which is their homeland (or has been until 1948 for many of them), have called this region Palestine or the Arabic equivalent for a very long time. In other words, there have been Palestinian Arabs for many centuries, but the national identity of Palestinians — which is an Arab national identity— dates back to the late 19th century at the earliest. The confusion stems from the fact that there hasn’t been a neat or precise point in time when the Palestinian Arabs have “transformed” from “Arabs of Palestine” to “the Arab nationality of Palestinians”, because it doesn’t work like that in real life.",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1ez4vs0/is_this_why_is_it_called_palestine_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1ez4vs0/is_this_why_is_it_called_palestine_and/ljij8ub

I’ve heard two different possible etymologies of the name, one is that Palestina comes from Philistia, and is meant as an insult to the Jews. 

The other is that Palestina comes from Greek, and I believe Herodotus referred to the region as a district of Syria named Palestinê in the 5th century bce. This name may also be derived from the Phillistines, who were also known as the Peleset.

And here people do call the west bank Judea and Samaria. But thats considered by many especially outside of Israel to be politically and ideologically encumbered.

It has many names
the Philistines, the Sea People are bronze age collapse inhabitants In the southern coastal area (ruled by the Egyptians usually)
the Cananites are the southern edge of the Phonician population, the collapse of the Phonicians as a People brought two very related tribes (maybe once united, maybe not, even in legend this is a very brief period) the northern trade kingdom of Israel/Samaria and the south eastern hill kingdom of Judiah

After the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem, the Babylonians put a loyal local government centred around the city, the province was named Judia thr province of the Jews
After the Parsian conquest, the Greek conquest and the Roman conquest a series of bloody revolts ended by the Romans reorganising the area and renaming the new province Palestine .
During the next 1300 years, the area was named and renamed many times. The Christian name was actually often ""The Holy Land"" 
The Ottoman empire (who ruled the area for the longest recorded time) actually split the province as they often did to avoid civil fermentation. They also often moved populations around. They used Palestine as the name that was used afterwards by the British.
The land called Israel is both the name of the nation and a theoretical border of the current (beloved) sovereign state, it has many variations from the Complete Land of Israel, the Two Sides of The River and to the much smaller UN separation plan (1945), the 1948 cease fire line and the 1967 borders.

2024-09-23 14:43:38,Israel,Palestine,1fnizpy,loj63bx,“Palestine” as a name for Israel derives from an ancient Greek pun on “wrestler”,">  
The name Israel arose from the incident in which Jacob wrestled with an angel (Genesis 32:25–27). Jacob received the name Israel (*Yisra’el* in Hebrew) because he “wrestled (*sarita’*) with the Lord (*El*).” In the Septuagint, the Greek verb *epalaien* (he wrestled) is used to describe Jacob’s struggle with the stranger.[^(14)](https://library.biblicalarchaeology.org/endnote/endnote-14-when-palestine-meant-israel/) The etymological similarity between *epalaien* and *Palaistinê* raises the possibility that *Palaistinê* may somehow be linked to the name Israel through this Biblical episode.  


  
Interesting theory!  
Whatever the etymology is, a few things are certain:

  
1) The name Palestine was invented by White European Colonizers (Greeks and then Romans), nobody in Palestine called their land Palestine back then. When Arabs colonized the land they picked up the name from the Byzantines. It's as indigenous as ""New York"" and ""Greenland"".   
  
2) The Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Ottomans, all viewed Palestine as a rural region of Greater Syria, not a distinct country as the local Jews viewed it.",25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1fnizpy/palestine_as_a_name_for_israel_derives_from_an/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1fnizpy/palestine_as_a_name_for_israel_derives_from_an/loj63bx

>In a private conversation with media and business executives, CIA director Bill Burns, who’s been involved in the ceasefire/hostage deal negotiations, assessed that Hamas’s leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, is facing growing pressure from his own military commanders to end the war and accept the proposed deal. Furthermore, Sinwar is now especially aware of the growing public pressure and anger within Gaza towards Hamas due to the “enormity of the suffering” that civilians are experiencing, causing the group’s chief, who is “not concerned with his own mortality,” to feel the pressure that may result in an opening in negotiations. Once again, a suicidal psychopath has been dragging the Palestinians down because he wants to be a martyr and doesn’t care if all of Gaza is destroyed with him. He literally said years ago that “we will all die and burn” before backing down.  
  
>So, here’s something that I’ve been saying repeatedly throughout the war and was attacked, mocked, or ignored for it: why didn’t the pro-Palestine community and protesters demand that Hamas accept a ceasefire deal? Why not call for the hostages to be released along with the calls for a ceasefire? Why not direct some of the passionate sentiments towards the Islamist group to make it feel some public pressure to end the war that it started? People kept saying, “Oh, we don’t have influence over Hamas, but we can influence our government, which supports Israel.” Hogwash! Hamas paid close attention to the worldwide demonstrations and international pressure that it was solely counting on to stop the war. Their whole strategy was that the global outcry against the horrendous suffering and mass killings in Gaza would force Israel to end the war on Hamas’s terms.  
  
>Worse, not only did Hamas not face any calls to moderate its stance, but it actually received massive support among the diaspora communities and “allies” who embraced extreme anti-Israel positions, supported armed resistance, celebrated October 7, promoted maximalist views, and refused to hold Hamas accountable for its egregious and evil recklessness that got Gaza destroyed and tens of thousands needlessly killed. After nine months of failed international pressure to end the war, Hamas is slowly acknowledging that its master plan to stop the war has failed. And damned be the people of Gaza, who are cannon fodder for nefarious Jihadi ideologies and Iranian aspirations for regional dominance.  
  
>If you didn’t see this during the war; if you mindlessly played along and let misguided and ill-informed activists guide your speech and actions; if you failed to place any blame or responsibility on Hamas for starting this war and refusing to bring it to a swift end, this nine-month-long mess is partially on you – you are morally, ethically, karmically, politically, spiritually and common-sensically (Yes, I made up that word) responsible for where we are today in Gaza. Sit with that if you really care and want to try something different – it’s not too late to adjust course and stop promoting Hamas and its armed resistance narrative that kills/destroys Palestinians and worsens the occupation of their lands.

In addition to the US example, you can also cite how the Knesset threshold of 3.25% disempowers small segments of the electorate by literally making their votes “wasted”. 

You might be able to achieve a similar outcome with Knesset representation by district/region, given the geographic concentration of Haredim in Bnei Brak and Jerusalem. But then you run into the public relations problem of districts across the Green Line, in which Arab noncitizens cannot vote. So you’d have to make up one large district (with multiple seats to account for population size) of “Israelis outside the Green Line.” But then you can’t set up voting stations in the settlements without doing the same for Israelis living in the US, Europe, etc. They’d avoid that problem by only setting up voting stations inside the Green Line where residents of the settlements can just drive in to vote.

Ok i just read your edit and noticed your age. Kudos for being up to the challenge of debating in favore of israel at such a young age! Learning history is key so im going to add some links for you. Please stay away from arguing with islamists and antisemites though, your safety is more important! 

Also stay away from videos and photos of atrocities. At your age you can read descriptions because knowing the truth is important but seeing images and videos of atrocities is very damaging for the human psychology at such a young age, it can cause you to develop ptsd and other issues. Please don't look at war or pogrom footage and images!

It is true that the land was once called Palestine, but there was never a Palestinian state. The arabs that currently live in Israel/Palestinian territories never ONCE had their own country.

Quite simply, they named themselves after the land and are using that to pretend they've been there forever. Palestinian identity as we know it today did not even come into being until after 1967... Arabs in the pre-1948 Israel/Palestine wanted to be part of Syria, and in fact Jews were describing themselves as Palestinian around that same time.

It's all bullshit. They will never admit to the truth, because lies are central to their identity.

This occurred during both the Ottoman and the British administrations, beginning in the mid to late 1800's. They tried to buy the areas in the hills (the West Bank today), but nobody would sell to them. So they had to buy the coastal swamps and inland deserts. The Jews were able to turn the environment into very productive land. When the war ended and the UN approved the partition plan mostly along the major lines of ownership, Israel accepted and declared independence. The Arab League (representing Palestine) rejected it and declared war, and lost. That was the beginning of the Nakba, which is common to hear brought up. Many Arabs left their homes because they were told to, and they were not allowed to come back. Similar things happened to Jews who lived in Arabs areas, but on a smaller scale because they didn't lose.

2024-06-09 05:11:11,Israel,Palestine,1dbky5x,l7ry7px,ELI5: Did Israel buy Palestine?,"First, a quick history of the region.

Jews were expelled from Judea by the Romans around the 2nd century CE and the land was renamed Syria-Palaestina after the Philistines, Biblical enemies of the Jews, to mock them. During the Byzantine period, the region was split into 3 provinces named Palaestina Prima, Palaestina Secunda, and Palaestina Tertia. 
After the Muslim conquest, the region became a military district named Jund Filastin, which encompassed most of Prima and Tertia and established a new city named Ramla as its capital. Later it became the Kingdom of Jerusalem (Latin Kingdom) and some time after that it was held by the Mamluk Sultanate. The Ottoman Empire was the last entity that held that region before the British Mandate of Palestine and later the establishment of the State of Israel.

And now for some details about how the State of Israel was established.

After World War II all the empires collapsed and national identity became the main goal, so the Jews decided to gather on land that was [legitimately] bought and owned by other Jews and later tried to establish a homeland with the help of the British Empire. It was met with a lot of aggression from the Arab-Muslims, because they didn't want a state that was under Jewish rule. They had no problem having Jews and Christians on that land, as long as it was under Islamic rule and non-Muslims were considered dhimmi who pay jizya (a taxation on non-Muslims). Long story short they initiated a war which they lost and the Jews gained territory and established a home on their historical homeland (hooray), except the West Bank and Gaza, which were occupied by Jordan and Egypt respectively until the 1967 war.

TL;DR Yes, the Jews bought and owned land in Palestine, wanted to establish a home on said lands, but because the local Arab-Muslims didn't like it they initiated a war and lost, which resulted in Israel gaining more territory because of that.",17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1dbky5x/eli5_did_israel_buy_palestine/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1dbky5x/eli5_did_israel_buy_palestine/l7ry7px

Israel: A Concise History of a Nation Reborn by Daniel Gordis is a pretty good entry level place to start if you want to know the history of Israel. It goes over the major stuff and the general context around them. 

Despite the narrative of many Israeli history and involvement didn't start in 1948. Becoming a nation in a certain year doesn't mean that the people there were new. That's just moreso how the world was back then. As so much lived under one empire or another. You can say similar things about most of Africa and Asia and even some of Europe.

2024-06-09 07:59:03,Israel,Palestine,1dbky5x,l7sd8o0,ELI5: Did Israel buy Palestine?,"For context, the name Palestine comes from the Romans - who, after an unsuccessful Jewish revolt against Roman occupation of Judea in the 2nd century, renamed the land Syria-Palestina. It's important to keep in mind that the land renamed Palestine was never an independent state's territory - the land renamed Palestine was under occupation of this or that empire, taken by conquest. 

Now, did the first Zionists, Jews who raised funds and came to this land with the goal of reestablishing an independent Jewish state for the purpose of giving the Jewish people worldwide a safe haven, buy lands here peacefully? It's a bit complicated. Arab land owners often sold overpriced bad lands (such as malaria-filled swamps) to Zionists - these deals didn't come to blows, so technically they were peaceful, however this obviously isn't a fair deal. The Zionists took it because it was the best they could get but it was pretty scammy. 

The thing is, many Arabs at the time thought the Jews would soon give up on living in swamps and leave - however the Zionists came up with many solutions to the poor land conditions and dried up the swamps, actually built functioning towns, planting fields of crops, etc. This obviously meant the Jews were here to stay, so many Arabs had taken to attacking these new towns, burning fields and the like - so, was the aftermath of the monetary exchange over the lands peaceful? No.

Pro-Palestinians often point to what I've taken to call ""the four map myth"" - the first they show is a map of 19th century Palestine and say the entire land is Palestinian; this is false - the entire land is a province of the Ottoman Empire, with some lands being privately owned. The second is the same map with dots of blue that show Jewish-owned lands; these are the aforementioned lands, legally bought by Jews from the Arab landowners, the rest of the map is - again - Ottoman territory and not an independent Palestinian state. The third map they show is the Partition Plan presented in the UN on 29 November 1947, which about a 60-40 divide of the land into Arab and Jewish states; this map is purely theoretical, as it never came to be in reality - on 30 November the Arab citizens of the British Mandate of Palestine attacked the Jewish citizens, thus starting a civil war that came to be known as the Israel Independence War. The presentation of shift in territories conveniently skips the years 1948-2004, I suspect this is because in 1948-1967 parts of ""Palestine"" were conquered by Egypt, Jordan and Syria - this undermines the myth of Arab solidarity, or that the Arabs fought to help Palestinians as they've clearly taken the land for themselves (up until the 1980s Jordan argued that the West Bank is ""stolen"" Jordanian territory). Looking again at the 4-map myth, the next map we see is a 2005 map showing A Territories and Gaza Strip as Palestinian lands with the rest of the map being painted blue to signify Jewish ownership; this is the closest to truth the Four Maps display - Gaza Strip is in a complicated legal position but we can call it an autonomy, and the A Territories in the West Bank are in complete control of the Palestinian Authority, making them the first actually-Palestinian sorta-independent Palestinian lands in history. (B Territories in the West Bank are under shared PA-Israeli rule, Israel being responsible solely for security) 

This is obviously just the tip of the iceberg, no single comment on Reddit can give you the full picture. For a look at Israel-Palestine history leaning into the Israeli perspective I highly recommend Noa Tishbi's book, it's a good start for someone who wants to look deeper into this over-century-long conflict",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1dbky5x/eli5_did_israel_buy_palestine/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1dbky5x/eli5_did_israel_buy_palestine/l7sd8o0

At bare minimum it means the replacement of the current State of Israel with a non-Jewish State of Palestine. (Don't ask if the Jews will be allowed to stay at all, or under what conditions, never mind how badly they'd even want to.)

I would not suspect anyone of wanting to expropriate, drive out or kill Protestants *just* because they said *Tiocfaidh ar la* or ""Get England Out of Ireland"" (trust me, the English would be only too happy to get out of Northern Ireland; it's been an expensive embarrassment for decades), but given a chance I would ask them what they thought that meant, tell them more or less what I typed just now and then tell them this:

Khan KC: Applications for arrest warrants in the situation in the State of Palestine | International Criminal Court ,"I found reading the ICC prosecutor’s statement about the warrants very helpful, because the reporting about them in the media is very unclear, imprecise, and of course, horribly biased against Israel.

After reading the statement, my sense is that the ICC is pretty unlikely to grant the prosecutor’s application for warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant.  Legally the allegations are thin and there are serious jurisdictional problems because Israel is not a member of the ICC or a signatory to the Rome Statute. The prosecutor asserts without explanation that the Rome Statute applies because the alleged illegal conduct occured in the territory of a signatory - Palestine - but this is by no means obvious.

There are serious problems with the prosecutor’s argument, since: (a) it requires a finding that Gaza remains a part of “Palestine” despite not being governed by the PA; (b) even if it is “Palestine,” that it has not repudiated the Rome Statute by the governance of Hamas, which rejects the treaty; and (c) that government policy determinations of political leaders in Israel, who have not subjected themselves to the Rome Statute’s terms, constitute “conduct” in violation of the Rome Statute if effectuated in the territory of a signatory.

I think the ICC will be very hesitant to agree with the prosecutor on these controversial and unprecedented points, as doing so would immediately bring it into major conflict with not only the US, but every major power. International law operates on the basis of consent, via treaties and long held and ascribed customs. Application of the Rome Statute to two non-consenting parties (Hamas and Israel) is contrary to the basic foundations of international law that give it legitimacy.

The statement shows that the prosecutor is clearly aware of the legal and jurisdictional headwinds the application will face with the Judges, but he clearly felt obliged to submit the application anyways to make a statement.  That’s really not his role, but he’s just a prosecutor and I don’t see much reason to get too excited about it just yet. If the ICC actually issues the warrants against Gallant and Netanyahu, then I think it will be time for serious outrage and repercussions.",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1cwdjlr/statement_of_icc_prosecutor_karim_aa_khan_kc/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1cwdjlr/statement_of_icc_prosecutor_karim_aa_khan_kc/l4x8uhp

I am sure there are a few edge case nut jobs, but to describe that as representing a typical Israel supporter is pure fiction. 

That would be like telling me most Trump supporters want gay people to be free to do marry whoever they want or trans people to use any bathroom they want. It's just not plausible. 

You can check out project ask on Youtube and you can see the same questions asked to both Israelis and Palestinians. I don't think I have ever seen an Israeli say they want genocide or ethnic cleansing. On the Palestinian side however, it's rare to see someone that does not. And the ones that do want to live together often have to have their identity hidden for fear or retaliation against them from the PA. In Gaza they just hang anyone who cooperated with an Israeli.

The vast majority of Israelis and Israeli supporters want the Palestinians and Jews to be able to live together side by side and share the land. 

I don't know where you are meeting these people calling for genocide, but that is not normal.

Let’s pretend the following was written by an “anti Palestine should exist” Jewish American activist:

How would Palestinians & “palestine should exist supporters” like to see the conflict with Israel End: From an “Anti-Palestine should exist” Activist who Genuinely Wants to Better Understand you

I want to be 100% clear: I am not interested in debating anyone, trying to change minds, or even discussing my own views, I am posting here with a desire to learn more about people who view themselves as Palestinian/“Palestine should exist supporters”. You can obviously see from my post history that I am quite anti Palestine/“anti Palestine should exist”, but genuinely, I am posting here because I am interested in learning about the pro Palestine-“Palestine should exist” perspectives. 

I am Jewish so I have never been to Gaza. I also have never been to the West Bank. I have though been to israel twice, and have known several Palestinians personally. 
Those Palestinians I met in passing would speak to me and about people who came from my background (Jews) with the utmost condescension. 

Those Palestinians I know closely, even those I considered to be genuinely good, kind people, would eventually let those same views slip out as they became more comfortable with me, and also let their views slip out through unequal treatment of the people around them. (One such person was a teacher and tutor who would treat her Jewish and Israeli students more harshly and critically than students of other backgrounds. She actively discouraged me from pursuing further education, especially in the subject she taught. I have improved tremendously in it since then, but I have to be frank and say her words of discouragement did affect the path I took) I get a lot of news from the region by reading Al Jazeera and other Qatar funded news sites, who I am sorry to tell you make FOX News look like objective bastions of real journalism.

Obviously I understand that anecdotal experiences don’t define a community, and I want to do more work to understand you guys before being comfortable in my judgement. After the current conflict is over in addition to humanitarian work in israel, mostly the destroyed and incinerated kibbutzim near the Gaza border and the destroyed towns, infrastructure, agricultural fields, etc in the north due to Hezbollah, I would like to spend some in Gaza and the West Bank to try and meet more people there. 

This most likely won’t be allowed/legal for me to go and it wouldn’t be safe for me. I’ve never visited, not even when I was a kid, or a teen, and probably not now as an adult. 

I have a genuine interest in understanding what the average Palestinian wants a post conflict Israel and Palestine to look like. 

To be frank, with most interactions with American Palestinians and Palestine supporters, the conclusion they want is, and I am sorry if this upsets you to hear, genocide or ethnic cleansing. 

The most common solution I hear is a one state solution with Palestinians from the river to the sea with the Jews exiled. 

Extremists will suggest this happens “once israel is destroyed” and once “The Day of Judgement finally comes about when the Moslems fight the Jews (killing the Jews), and when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Moslems, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him.”

Is this viewpoint pretty reflective of Palestinian society? Or is it just palestinian Americans and pro Palestine supporters sitting between two oceans not understanding how the world works.

Saudi is moving in the right direction finally changing their school curriculum to stop educating children to believe Jews are vermin that should be killed and acknowledge Israel’s existence. Ironically it’s the Arabs in the Middle East that are a beacon of hope as they recognise how radicalisation has destroyed their social fabric and driven many of the conflicts in Israel. One relationships normalise with Israel and we removed Hamas which doesn’t want peace because as you probably have no idea every time peace talks started with Arafat (an Egyptian mind you) Hamas would send suicide bombers and rockets because Hamas just wants to kill Jews. Once Israel’s security is assured we can work towards a two state solution and the establishment of a Palestinians leadership or perhaps they want to drop the farce and come up with their own name and identity as opposed to naming themselves after the name the Greeks gave the land using letters which don’t exist in the Arabic alphabet. So yes like it would be nice as Israelis you simply acknowledge our rights to be alive and safe and stopped normalising killing and raping us and the pretense we are an illegal settle colony which is no different to any other country not withstanding 3500 years of Jewish history on the land.

**For the war**, Hamas replaced with a peaceful leadership that remove the radical ideas from the population and Israeli security control to prevent such massacre of the 7th Of October from returning. That would also allow Israel and Egypt to remove the blockade as it was put specifically to limit Hamas.

**As for the conflict,** one thing you'd see most Israelis and pro-Israeli talk about is security. Majority of Israelis and their supporters view Palestinians as a threat that wants to destroy them and kill them considering every peace offer Israel gave them resulted in Palestinian terror attack and in general the Palestinians never try any peaceful negotiation, only terror... Not to mention the polls among them prove the same thing (Big majority wants a Palestinian state from the river to the sea with no Jews, polls conducted on Palestinians from both territories).

So the specific final solution to the conflict is not what really matters... Majority of Israelis don't think about land specifically - they think about what can reduce the terror coming from the Palestinians. Majority of Israelis see the peaceful negotiations lead nowhere so they moved to a more defensive approach where Palestinians are allowed to determine their own rules but have many limitations preventing them from terrorizing Israel.

You need to remember Israel is considered a western country for a good reason - the people there follow the values of peace and quite, only wanting to live their lives (proven by all the peace deals Israel does with all of its neighboring Arab countries). However when Palestinians keep attacking them, no wonder Israeli's right-wing becomes stronger and stronger... They lost all trust with their behavior and they pay for it by the fact Israel trust them with noting. Even Israeli-Arabs grow further and further from other Palestinians as they see the Palestinians terror...

So overall, if you want to talk about a solution for the Palestinians, it doesn't matter if you talk about one state for both, 2 states, one state for only one group, etc... At the end of the day people don't think about peace as a possibility because they see the Palestinians as blood thirsty monsters who only try to destroy them and prove it to them each time they perform an act of terror supported by their leadership.",11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1d3sbgp/how_would_israelis_like_to_see_the_conflict_with/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1d3sbgp/how_would_israelis_like_to_see_the_conflict_with/l69ngti

2023-11-26 20:58:18,Israel,Palestine,184gvl2,kavuftq,"How wrong/true is the claim pro-Palestine supporters make about apparent ""75 year occupation""?","In 1964, the Palestine Liberation Organization was established and wrote in its original charter that ""this Organization does not exercise any regional sovereignty over the West Bank in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, on the Gaza Strip or the Himmah Area.""

In 1968, a year after Israel gained control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip following the Six Day War, they amended their charter to claim both the West Bank and Gaza as Palestinian lands.

The claim that Palestinians are also indigenous vaguely checks out due to both Arabic and Islam being appropriated and proselytized through conquests of the 7th Century CE. Presumed Palestinians who would be indigenous to the land would have likely been forcibly converted, which, as we know, is a common tactic to eradicate indigenous people within the Arab empire and beyond. 

Because it’s scientifically impossible to determine farther back than 6-8 generations at this time, it’s truly impossible to know who was forcibly converted, who conquered and stayed and who came some time after. This is a great example of how conquerers have left blind spots in our history from the standpoint of a dwindling community of living indigenous people. 

Essentially, at least until science could potentially figure out a way of going back 4,000 years through genetics, Palestinians sort of signed away their claim to the land when they reinvented their identities to meet that of the Muslims from Mecca. Like entering a new friend group and wanting to go back to the old one’s lunch table with the new friend group and the old friend group go find a new table when the new friend group has pushed a bunch of tables together (55 to be exact. Enough with the analogies? 

When Palestinians can find their property deeds from over 4,000 years ago, they can claim their right of return as Jewish converts but occupation would require denouncing Jews of being indigenous which would fail to prove their own indigenous credibility. (Because you cannot occupy your own land) 

They cannot have a Palestine without proof they don’t have and they cannot have it without Israel. It might not be worth their time to carry on but when you’ve been doing so for over 100 years, it might not be so easy to let it go. Palestinians really need to listen to Freakonomics’ episode “Failure is your Friend.”

Though TECHNICALLY considering the modern borders don’t align with ancient ones, Palestinians now known as Jordanians are carrying out their potential indigenous lives in a part of Jordan.",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/184gvl2/how_wrongtrue_is_the_claim_propalestine/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/184gvl2/how_wrongtrue_is_the_claim_propalestine/kavuftq

All of that doesn't matter except the rearming. How Israel leaves the war but maintains a credible halt to arms smuggling through Rafah is what will ultimately determine who won the war.

Even in a ceasefire and hostage exchange, Israel will look to assassinate Sinwar now. He's signed up for a life as a rat. I'm not sure he'll get his victory parade over the rubble he so desperately wants even when Israel does pull out of Gaza.

In terms of life for Gazans. I don't know what Arab country wants to pour billions of dollars into an enclave still run by Hamas.

2024-06-30 01:43:55,Israel,Palestine,1drpmmi,lax31dz,Whats your thoughts on Mahmoud Abbas (President of Palestine)?,">

I guess he's technically the best option for the Palestinians because unlike Hamas who actively participate in terror forcing Israel to put ton of supervision on them and attack them, he only supports terrorism so Israel can't technically do anything bad to his controlled areas.

But at the same time it also depends on what you mean by ""good for them"". According to the Palestinians: good = ""fight to destroy Israel no matter what it takes"" while for us (the western world) good = ""as little terror as can be""

>2. Is he a terrorist? Has he supported Hamas and then denounced Hamas before?.

Worse, he's a terrorist supporter. Which means he himself does not perform terror acts but he enables and support it.

It's worse because Israel can't do anything about it while against terrorists Israel can always beat them at war...

As for his relations with Hamas, it's a complicated relationship but I guess it's not too different than any rivalry between 2 opposing parties in a country... Both want the best for their country but hate each other.

>3.  Is he a Zionist?, whats his stance on Zionism? Is he pro Hamas?, Pro Palestine? Or neither?.

Not only he's not a Zionist, he literally blamed the Jews for WW2 and the holocaust.

He's as far as can be from a Zionist.

As for the ""pro-Hamas"" part, is Biden a pro-republican? is Trump a pro-Democrats? Same answer applies here.

As for ""pro-Palestine"", I mean - he's a Palestinians and he leads the PLO/PA which the world recognize as the official representative of Palestinians.

So even if Hamas is the one Palestinians support the most and the leader of Gaza - legally speaking Abbas is indeed the leader of the Palestinians. So Obviously he will be ""Pro-Palestine"" as a Palestinian and their official leader...

>4. Is Fatah a good organization? I dont know too much about Fatah. What is the good that Fatah has done? The US and Israel sees them as Allies.

In the past they were terrorists but after the Oslo accords they moved from doing terror to supporting terror.

What does it mean? They pay terrorists who do terror acts, teach their schools about the need to destroy Israel & the Jews, and refuse to actually do anything about that...

Fun fact, he payed for the terrorists who did the 7th of October massacre after the act despite them being from Gaza.

Israel doesn't see them as an ally...

As for what good has he done, he didn't attack Israel - does that count? There's also a security agreement with him so that's something I guess...

>5. Mahmoud Abbas doesnt seem like he is doing anything to help Palestine, what is his plans? Does he want to destroy Hamas? What is his plan for Palestine?

Tbh that's a really good question. On one hand he publicly calls for a 2-state solution and encourages it.

But on the other hand he refuses to do anything realistic to stop terrorism.

I think he wants to eat the cake and eat it whole.

He doesn't want to get into a war with Israel because he knows they will lose but he still wants free territory. So I think he's plan is mostly signing deals with Israel so he can get free territory and even a state but without any down sides.

It's not that he wants peace, he just doesn't think he will be able to get anything with violence (he's right), so he tries to use diplomacy as weapons.

As for Hamas, obviously he doesn't like them considering they are much more popular than him and might steal the leadership from him or his party in the future.",11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1drpmmi/whats_your_thoughts_on_mahmoud_abbas_president_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1drpmmi/whats_your_thoughts_on_mahmoud_abbas_president_of/lax31dz

>Anyone with more than two braincells DO NOT believe that israel doesn't have the right to exist. *We are only preaching non-violence*. 

You think that's what you're preaching but you're actually not.  This is precisely what has Jews around the world so angry and scared right now.

Let me give you some background.

In 1979, Israel gave the entire Sinai peninsula back to Egypt in exchange for a peace deal.  They gave land, and in return they got an end to the 30-year ongoing hostilities between them and Egypt.  Nice.

In 1994, Israel signed a peace deal with Jordan, and in return there has been a mostly stable border and diplomatic relations, and peace between the two countries.  Nice.

Every single time that Israel has made a peace deal, or attempted to make a peace deal with the Palestinians, the result has been more violence against Israelis.  Every.  Single.  Time.

The best example of this is when Israel offered the Palestinians a state including \~95% of the West Bank and the result was a huge wave of suicide bombings - \*against civilians\* in Israel.  It's fair to ask why the Palestinians and their leadership would do this?

The answer - and the piece of information that most people such as yourselves are missing - is that \*the Palestinians only want a state if it means they can dismantle Israel and take it all for themselves.\*

Are there moderate Palestinians who want a two-state solution and just to live in peace?  Sure.  Just like there are lots of Israelis who want the same.  \*But these are not the people running things, launching rockets, attacking Israelis\*.

When you chant ""from the river to the sea, Palestine must be free"" - that river and that sea are the borders \*of Israel\*.  What that statement means is ""we get Israel"".  And lest you think that would mean some kind of one-state confederation (which no one on either side currently wants), the Arabic version of that chant is ""from the water to the water, Palestine is Arab"".

Further, if you're American or European, you should consider that imposing some half-educated version of what you think either side actually wants or would do or should do \*is imperialist\*.

So when you say you ""only want peace"" anyone with an actual knowledge of this region has a fair question: ""peace for whom?""

Everyone in the region, you might say, but especially for the oppressed Palestinians.

""Okay, how will that happen?  What would that look like?""

and that's when the crickets come in - if you're lucky.  If you're not, you get ""you are a racist!  you support genocide!""

But the \*truth\* is that \*most people\* want peace in the region.  Most everyone hates war.  No one likes to see little kids suffering.

But simply wanting peace does not make you a fucking military or political genius or some kind of revolutionary warrior.  It just makes you a decent human being.  That's what we see when we see people like you at these protests: people who might as well be holding up signs that say, ""I want to be a good person but I don't have any idea what's happening!  I believe everything I see on social media!""

I mean, kudos for you for actually visiting this sub and learning what the other side believes.

Happy to engage with you in more dialogue.

Btw, you know who doesn't actually want peace?  Who has never wanted peace and who is really openly very fucking honest about never wanting peace?

Hamas.

edit: you know what absolutely no one at these protests is waving around?  Signs that say, ""I SUPPORT MODERATE PALESTINIAN VOICES WHO LEGITIMATELY WANT PEACE AND COEXISTENCE"".  If you're not saying that, you're supporting the most violent opponents of peace in the region.  Remember that people at these protests think there's an actual genocide going on.  Remember that people at these protests think Hamas are freedom-loving revolutionaries who would lay down their weapons if they ever got political independence.  But what actually happened is that when they got a taste of independence in 2005 they used immediately to \*build a multi billion dollar terrorist state\* and attack Israel over and over and over again.  If you're really for peace as your primary goal, you should just shut up and ignore this conflict altogether because neither side actually wants peace right now.

Israel would prefer zero civilian casualties, but Hamas makes that impossible. Hamas prefers as many civilian casualties on both sides as possible, and they set the stage to make that happen.

2023-12-24 18:09:49,Israel,Palestine,18pycfm,kerln1f,My Thoughts About How To Debate The Israel-Palestine Conflict,">Let's skip to the bottom line - debating the history of the region is not only a lost cause, it's actually a red herring when discussing the conflict.

>Things our ancestors did or didn't do, who said what to who, who thought what, who started, who ended, none of it matters.

This is the first issue, they are still living in the past and it is supported by actions as well, take for example the refugee problem in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan ( to some extent) ect.,the avoidance of creating a palestinian state with what they had ect. , their whole strategy is to view all events after 1948 as continuing events. the whole strategy is literally to keep the Nakba relevant when it is indeed dead a long time ago.

There has been billions of dollars invested in this strategy, the brainwashing is so severe, and that's why until this day they still believe Israel could go away one day.
. 

>So, how do we, given the current situation and that no-one is going anywhere, how do we get to peace?

The Palestinian side doesn't want peace it wants a ceasfire, it is very idiotic talking about solution when you are the only one who is sitting in the table.

Like i always say, if the Israeli side woke up Norwegian and the palestinian side stayed the same, nothing much will change. If the Palestinian side woke up Norwegian and the israeli side stayed the same, the whole conflict will be solved!

So now,what is the problem with the Palestinian side? Well, the problem with the palestinian side is not (mostly) exclusive to the palestinian people, there is an Arab problem and most importantly an Islam problem, this should be aknowledged.

The Palestinians and Arabs have been and are still being Brainwashed for a long time, their mentality is broken and it is not compatible with the idea of peace alongside with otger values, so the solution is changing the mentality so they could be capable of doing so.

There is no palestinian cause, it doesn't exist, it died a long time ago, Events that should be important are not important to them, their problems are not your problems and their solutions are not your solutions. I am sadly saying this as a palestinian from diaspora who still has family in the west bank. There is too much to say that i cannot even know from where to start.

But i want to say one last thing, Destroying Hamas will help, let me explain :

Hamas is maybe the only ""thing"" that all arabs really have a holy image of, They are like : those are Hamas! They cannot even theoritically lose! They are soldiers of Allah! They are incabaple of being defeated, And that portray is exclusive for Hamas, no other Force in the middle east has that. So if Hamas gets beaten, It will be a hell of a Schock, Everyone will start questioning alot of things, they might finally understand that they have been betrayed. It will serve as a big reality check, so when Hamas gets destroyed, palestinians will know that nothing is going to be gained by violence, and anything stronger than Hamas will never come, they will lose hope like germany when dresden was flattened, or at least i hope.

Look at the PFLP now, they are irrelevant, irrelevant for Israel and Irrelevant for the palestinians, they even make fun of them that all they do is dancing on Earth Day and singing, they pretty much don't have any value, and these same people were once THE palestinian revolutionary most powerful force, they hijacked planes, assassinated prime ministers and ministers and did operations in Munich and all over the world.

But know they don't have any value, they were finished and when they were finished the idea of Leftism, Comunism and Marxism has died with them, then a new ideology came into existence and occupied the heads of the arab and palestinian people and that is Islamizim.

Also you gotta now that palestine is in the receiving end of ideologies, it really just get filled with what ever ideology is common in a particular time, what helped the PFLP was that the Idea of Pan Arabism and Marxism, Communism was still the dominating ideology, but with the fall of that ideology in the west represented by the Fall of the Soviets and then the fall of their followers aka the Pan arabism Regimes in Iraq ( Saddam Hussein), Egypt (Abdul Nasser) before that  ect ect ect.

This whole ideology died physically and as an idea in the masses mind.

It got replaced with islamization when the islamic revolt happened in Iran, there was a vacuum of ideoligies and the Khomeini in Iran had a big role in starting this Domino effect of filling the Vaccum of ideologies, Salafit in Saudis, Afghanistan, Muslim brotherhood in multiple arabic countries, Hamas and Hezbollah were created ect.

Now it seems that the domino pieces are going to fall again (it already started falling by Saudi Arabia beginning to be more westrenized and Sisi being the president of egypt after making a coup on the Muslim brotherhood ect.)

But still Hamas is the most big Domino piece, if it falls it will be easier for other pieces to fall, and also the Saudi Israeli peace will change the middle east for ever.

It will be the starting of something new, Ofc, Iran and Qatar should be tackled and i think that will be on the goals list of Saudis and Israelis, they are their common enemy.

After that their will be a vaccum and Saudi Arabia will fill it with whatever agenda they have, And from what i see, i can be a bit optimistic.

 it is always forgotten how easy is to brainwash people, it is always underestimated. Saudi and Qatar were a big part of brainwashing arabs into islamizm, it was very obvious for any third party inspector, Saudi is starting to shifting it's way,but Qatar and Aljazeera are still, so they have to be tackled.",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/18pycfm/my_thoughts_about_how_to_debate_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/18pycfm/my_thoughts_about_how_to_debate_the/kerln1f
2023-12-24 19:30:57,Israel,Palestine,18pycfm,kerxwr7,My Thoughts About How To Debate The Israel-Palestine Conflict,"You think like a product manager; I like that. Your bottom-line question is great. Let’s try to answer it:

In order to have peace, both sides must be interested in it. Before October 7th, I would say that most Israelis were interested in peace, but the Palestinian leaders dragged their feet.
Currently, none of us want peace.
In order for both sides to want peace in the first place, the Palestinians or their leaders (but preferably both) should:
Condemn Hamas and any terror attacks against Israel immediately. This means dropping all their weapons and dismissing any martyr conceptions that support such actions.
Condemn any party or group that claims peace agreements are only a stepping stone towards a bigger cause, which is to destroy Israel and declare Palestine as a sovereign state. This is a crucial step towards peace since there’s no point discussing any agreement if that conception still exists among the Palestinians.
Acknowledge Israel as a Jewish state.
Forget about the right of return.
All the above conditions must be met before peace discussions can be anywhere near relevant. If any Palestinian leader ever agrees to even one of these conditions, he (or, God forbid, she) will face “severe consequences”. I won’t elaborate further on what severe consequences means.

In summary, too many events should happen for this dream to come true.",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/18pycfm/my_thoughts_about_how_to_debate_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/18pycfm/my_thoughts_about_how_to_debate_the/kerxwr7

2024-08-31 13:24:43,Israel,Palestine,1f5lcj4,lktulia,The casual hate towards Israelis because of the war is so fucking disappointing.,"The Second Intifada was twenty+ years ago. That's an entire generation. And for the entire time since then, especially in internationally funded academic circles, Israel has been gratuitously, aggressively reframed to be the neocolonial, white aggressor against the poor, oppressed, brown Palestinians. And Israel has done too little to address either that revisionist reframing of the conflict, or the effects the conflict has on that continuous process of reframed narratives in real time. 

The reality of things has been obscured over those decades. That Israel is a tiny statelet of modern Western values and decolonization that emerged from the ashes of a legacy of 1500 years of alternatively barbaric Arab colonialism (pogroms beyond count whenever the dhimmi Jews got too uppity) and neglectful Arab tyranny (no investment into the region, ever). That history is obscured, selectively distorted and reframed in much so-called 'modern history', written and funded by weaponized antisemites who have tenure at name-brand western universities. Israel isn't an oppressor of a few million Palestinians; it's a survivor of the imperialist, misanthropic desires of 400+ million Arabs who have weaponized a small subfacet of their population as a spearhead against Israel. These are the truths which these people will never willingly allow to see the light of day. 

The West, in the meanwhile, is too distracted with rejecting its own cultural legacy in the name of rejecting racism, and in the process has lost sight of how some cultures are just better than others. And certain powerful factions within the west are taking Russian, Chinese, Qatari, Iranian money in order to act as pawns in peddling these corrupt narratives. All factions that have nothing but enmity for Israel, Israel in its capacity as a home for Jews, or Israel as a potent American ally in a valuable region; take your pick.

The arab narrative is a back filled false narrative that says that jews have no standing anywhere in the mideast, in fact, as I just mentioned elsewhere, muslims don't tolerate any non muslims - it's just handy that jews are the first they are trying to wipe out.

The PLO was formed in the 60s, that's the first time arabs called themselves ""palestinians"". The PLO IS(was) a terrorist group, they, in different names, have been committing acts of terrorism for over 50 years.

So let's assume these are West Bank children (Gaza is, for the foreseeable future, off the table): ignoring the idea that you'll be bringing Palestinian children into Israeli territories (because the other way around is **not** going to work, period), and ignoring the idea that you'll need convince Palestinian families to send their children into Israel, and ignoring the fact that some of those children are indoctrinated to hate and kill Jews, 


What good will it do once the Palestinian child is back across the border? 

Would the Palestinian primary education system (which incidentally is not _entirely_ bad as it is led and funded by many Western international aid groups which results in Palestinians having some of the highest literacy rates in the world) want to give up its students for the Israeli primary education system (I've been to public elementary school in Israel, and I doubt I'd send my kids there in its current state)? 

Would the child return to his home in the West Bank and want to talk to his family about Israeli ideas and the things they study there?

Would you have to create an entirely new education system that involves Palestinian and Israeli funding together? 


Don't get me wrong it would be great to believe that this _could_ be the norm, but mixing children and educations is not in any way happening before getting normalization and full cooperation between the populations",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1d6vfba/what_if_israel_and_palestine_created_joint/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1d6vfba/what_if_israel_and_palestine_created_joint/l6vfi20

Some do and some prefer to send their children to Arab-speaking schools (there are zoning limitations; children can only go to schools which aren't too far from their homes). Israel generally doesn't allow hate speech of any kind in its schools, except possibly in the more radical settler communities.

Palestinians see the destruction of Israel as a core part of their identity, and their schools brainwash their children to hate Jews. You can easily find clips of Palestinian *toddlers* saying antisemitic sayings like ""I hate Jews"", ""I want to kill Jews"" and ""I want to die a martyr"".

They want to think there’s another way. Funny how they never tell us what that way is. 

If we don’t destroy Hamas they will kill more of our children, butcher our families and rape our women. 

The only way to stop them is bombing them where they are. 

If civilians can’t or won’t get out of the way, we still legally can bomb the enemy. We legally must. 

It’s horribly disingenuous to see people focusing on the tragedy of dead bodies but taking the easy way out in not having to address the context or offer a solution. 

It’s a selfish thing for them to do. And it’s not their country at risk. They don’t risk their lives or have to deal with having innocent families butchered like we have to deal with. And yet they dare tell us we have other options in this war? 

Of course, if we manage to convince them we are not committing war crimes, they will then direct attention to what predated Oct 7, breeches of international law, as if any of the humanitarian crisis is Israel’s fault. 

They will say an occupation and apartheid led to resistance. And in resistance, if you push people to desperation, the way they lash out says more about the oppression than the act itself.

2024-04-11 03:13:05,Israel,Palestine,1c0x881,kz0vr2m,Why did the UN Split mandatory palestine in 2,"I’ll give you an extremely abridged summary because the history of the region during the 20th century is incredibly complex involving numerous powers and characters fighting for influence. 

By 1947, Britain was practically bankrupt from World War 2 and exhausted by the turmoil in its rapidly collapsing empire (most notably, the situation in India). Both the Arabs and the Jews that were in Mandatory Palestine were engaged in an ethnic conflict that was rapidly increasing in hostility. While both sides were antagonistic to each other, they were united by one thing; their mutual hatred of the British Mandate and their desire to see it end. This resulted in British soldiers stationed there being subject to abuse, terrorism, and violence. Britain, having failed over the previous two decades to convince any of the parties to agree to their various solutions, declared that regardless of anything else, they were retreating from the region. They subsequently handed the issue over to newly formed United Nations to come up with a solution. The UN formed a special committee to thoroughly examine the issue and two proposals were drawn up. The minority view was that the mandate should not be partitioned and instead a single state with a complex system of representation in Parliament should be created. The majority of the committee, however, rejected that proposal as impractical as neither the Jews nor the Arabs desired it and they predicted that it would lead to inevitable civil war as demonstrated by the situation already on the ground. The majority position proposed partitioning the land into two states, one Arab and one Jewish with, however, full economic union and rights to travel between the two (subject to reasonable security concerns). Jerusalem and Bethlehem would be entirely separate from these two states and instead would belong to the international community collectively. The majority position was subsequently presented to the General Assembly as Resolution 181 and adopted with the requisite number of votes. The Jews celebrated the vote but the Arab members of the UN who lost the vote (and the Arabs in Mandatory Palestine) declared that they would not recognize its validity. At the conclusion of the British Mandate, Israel declared independence and the Arab states invaded to join the Arabs already fighting the Jews in the region. Resolution 181 was thus never implemented. And the rest, as they say, is history.",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1c0x881/why_did_the_un_split_mandatory_palestine_in_2/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1c0x881/why_did_the_un_split_mandatory_palestine_in_2/kz0vr2m

Over the last 1000 years, the geographical region now known as Israel has been home to various independent states, empires, and entities. Here are some notable ones:

1. **Kingdom of Jerusalem (1099-1291)**: Established during the First Crusade, the Kingdom of Jerusalem was a Christian Crusader state in the Levant, including parts of modern Israel.
2. **Ayyubid Sultanate (1171-1260)**: Founded by Saladin, the Ayyubid Sultanate controlled territories in the Levant, including parts of modern Israel.
3. **Mamluk Sultanate (1250-1517)**: The Mamluk Sultanate, based in Egypt, ruled over the Levant, including present-day Israel, after defeating the Crusaders.
4. **Ottoman Empire (1517-1917)**: After defeating the Mamluks, the Ottomans controlled the region, including Israel, until the end of World War I.
5. **British Mandate for Palestine (1920-1948)**: After World War I, the League of Nations granted Britain a mandate over Palestine, including what is now Israel, until the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.
6. **State of Israel (1948-present)**: Established in 1948, Israel declared independence and has since been recognized as a sovereign state by the international community.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1c8ltm0/which_existing_states_and_countries_including/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1c8ltm0/which_existing_states_and_countries_including/l0pjyip

Second + third photos show information about the passport as well as some biographical information, while the fourth page shows regulations related to the passport. Notice how in the fifth picture, which is of the ""back"" (or front, if you're a Hebrew or Arabic speaker) we see the abbreviation for Eretz Yisrael.

Photos 6-7:

ID card for a ""gymnasium"" (Hebrew school) in Tel Aviv, date unknown but assumed 1920s/1930s.

She should have no voice in any of this, I only want to hear from scientists. Not irrelevant Palestinian voices. Wtf.

For anyone curious, the below is why useful idiots like Greta don’t know a damn thing about this conflict:

>Hamas leaders in 1993 were recorded on a wiretapped conversation stating that their goal was to deceive the American public into supporting Hamas by appealing to the American left’s denouncement of oppression.

>Mousa Abu Marzook, a senior Hamas official, formed a far-left academic think tank, The United Association for Studies and Research (UASR), based out of Chicago to start disseminating this deception.

Deep down a lot of us truly can't fathom that kind of hate, because there is no one we hate in that way. We don't understand the depth of evil.

But it was the videos of civilians that really made an impact on me. When those random crowds of people were pushing each other out of the way to try to get their hits in on those lifeless bodies. That's when i realized ""omg, they are all in a cult"". 

One disagreement tho, I don't think it's bad ppl necessarily trying to lie about Islamic fundamentalism. We lie to ourselves, i've lied to myself. Because the alternative is painful to think about. It's painful for many people to acknowledge that the people they have been supporting all this time ""the oppressed"", are in fact compromised by a very sick and evil ideology.

I have heard so many things from pro-palestine, and it's pretty good assumption that around 80%+ of the movement is people who have no idea what they are talking about and just repeat the slogans they heard online

""Genocide"" ""apratheid"" and ""war crimes"" became buzz words with no real meaning because of those people",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1d7qd9n/free_palestine_is_people/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1d7qd9n/free_palestine_is_people/l71y2yl

Many refugees are in Jordan and getting more and more into the society and have citizenship. 
Jordanians and West Bank Palestinians visit each other all the time and are getting married and having kids. 
Eventually Jordan will have Palestinian majority, it’s a matter of a few decades. 

Take it or leave it but the West Bank is going to stay in the position it is right now for another 76 years. 
No Palestinian state is going to be formed with this generation or Israelis, we’re traumatized after October 7th and have resentment that won’t fade away in our lifetime.
