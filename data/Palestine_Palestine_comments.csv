2024-02-26 13:59:41,Palestine,Palestine,1b0i5ig,ks7urra,US Airmen Aaron Bushnell has Died After Setting Himself on Fire outside The Israeli Embassy. His Final Words were “Free Palestine”,"[https://medium.com/@chrisjeffrieshomelessromantic/us-airmen-aaron-bushnell-has-died-after-setting-himself-on-fire-outside-the-israeli-embassy-65c00eeb10f1](https://medium.com/@chrisjeffrieshomelessromantic/us-airmen-aaron-bushnell-has-died-after-setting-himself-on-fire-outside-the-israeli-embassy-65c00eeb10f1) 

On **February 25, 2024**, the world witnessed a harrowing act of protest outside the **Embassy of Israel in Washington, D.C.** United States military serviceman **Aaron Bushnell** set himself on fire, engulfed in flames, as a desperate plea against the ongoing **Israel–Hamas war**. [His last words echoed through the smoke and pain: “I will no longer be complicit in genocide.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-immolation_of_Aaron_Bushnell)

# The Tragic Act

Bushnell’s self-immolation was broadcast live on **Twitch**, capturing the raw intensity of his anguish. [As the flames consumed him, he repeatedly screamed, “Free Palestine.” His sacrifice marked a grim milestone: the first time an active-duty member of the United States military had immolated themselves in protest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-immolation_of_Aaron_Bushnell)

# The Motivation

Bushnell’s message was clear: he could no longer bear the weight of complicity. His planned act of protest was a response to the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [In a message sent to media outlets before the incident, he wrote, “Today, I am planning to engage in an extreme act of protest against the genocide of the Palestinian people.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-immolation_of_Aaron_Bushnell)

# Apartheid and Discrimination

To understand the context behind Bushnell’s desperate act, we must delve into the deeply entrenched issues plaguing the region. The **occupied Palestinian territory** has become a crucible of discrimination, where a dual legal and political system privileges Israeli Jewish settlers while leaving millions of Palestinians without rights. Here are some stark realities:

1. **Legal Disparities**: Within the same geographic space, Israeli settlers enjoy privileges, while more than three million Palestinians face institutional discrimination. [Walls, checkpoints, and roads separate these communities, perpetuating inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-immolation_of_Aaron_Bushnell)
2. **Gaza’s Desperation**: Another two million Palestinians reside in Gaza, often described as an “open-air prison.” They lack adequate access to basic necessities like power, water, and healthcare. [Their economy is collapsing, and their freedom of movement is severely restricted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-immolation_of_Aaron_Bushnell)
3. **Apartheid Allegations**: International human rights experts, including the UN Special Rapporteur, have labeled Israel’s policies as apartheid. The discriminatory regime prioritizes Jewish Israelis over Palestinians based on racial-national-ethnic identity.",453,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1b0i5ig/us_airmen_aaron_bushnell_has_died_after_setting/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1b0i5ig/us_airmen_aaron_bushnell_has_died_after_setting/ks7urra

3. All IDF citizens who are active military or intelligence or are of age to be mobilized under IDF government law will be detained in whatever country they are found. 
4. A general embargo will be implemented that will ban ALL arms to the IDF government.
5. All imports of luxury goods to the IDF government will be banned.
6. Oil and food imports will be limited to the bare minimum needed to avoid total collapse. 
7. Any move to seize munitions from US bases within the territory of the IDF government will be treated as an act of war.
8. These measures will be lifted only after the complete succession of genocidal acts by the IDF government. Embargoed items will be returned incrementally as the IDF government surrenders it's government officials to the ICC. 
9. The United Nations will take over the administration of former IDF government territory. All discriminatory laws will be repealed immediately. All stolen land will be returned. All settlers will be investigated with appropriate criminal charges applied. All leaders of the settler community will be sent to the ICC.

And immigrants have always been scapegoated for local problems while also being the most exploited and marginalized populations. Every time there is an economic downturn the rich and their allies in gov't and corporate media use immigrants as a pawn to distract from the real causes of hardship (wealth hoarding).

Or that they made a little mistake, and they will try better next time.""

Not fun fact: US Leahy Laws are supposed to limit weapons sales to foreign entities that commit human rights violations. Within the US Leahy Laws, only Israel has a special mention of our trust in their judicial process, that allows Israel to investigate themselves and report to us to determine their own eligibility for further US weapons sales. No other foreign nation gets that parameter. 

It's discussed in further detail in a Guardian article titled [‘Different rules’: special policies keep US supplying weapons to Israel despite alleged abuses

](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/18/us-supply-weapons-israel-alleged-abuses-human-rights)

Excerpt:
The two-page 2021 agreement, which has received little media attention, formalized changes in the Leahy law and included a statement about how Israel has a “robust, independent and effective legal system, including its military justice system”. The US signed more than two dozen similar agreements with other countries at that time – including Greece, Jordan, Georgia, Ukraine and Latvia – but none contain language endorsing the other countries’ military justice systems. ...

Tim Rieser, a longtime senior adviser to Leahy, who helped write the Leahy law in the 1990s, said the inclusion of the language was probably intended to help Israel avoid scrutiny under the Leahy law, because it suggests as a matter of fact that Israel’s military justice system is independent enough to address any alleged human rights violations.

“The language added to the US-Israel agreement, without any consultation with Congress, is factually inaccurate and wrongly suggests that the [Leahy] Law doesn’t need to be applied,” Rieser said.",63,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1d2u4ek/how_many_more_charred_corpses_does_the_president/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1d2u4ek/how_many_more_charred_corpses_does_the_president/l62wbnt

They were the ones who originally attended the protests like I remember seeing a video from London in the 20th century where only  Palestinians and other Arabs protested but they spent their time educating and advocating for the rights of Palestinians which led to great results. 

Second of all, this war due to social media and smartphone technology is one of the most well-documented wars and it is not fought by conventional armies therefore the heartbreaking videos coming out from Gaza is making it easier to sympathise with the cause. 

Third of all, Western governments are complicit therefore there is actually a reason to protest like Zionists always bring up that the West didn’t protest against Bashar or Daesh but there was no need to protest because Syria was under international sanctions and Daesh had a coalition against it while in the case of Israel, the West is giving full support to Israel which can make people feel guilty and feel like that they are on the wrong side of the history. 

The last reason I could mention that the openly genocidal behaviour by Israeli leaders, Western politicians and media + pictures and videos published by IDF soldiers are something difficult to ignore which can also be a great motivation for Westerners and everyone in general to speak up and protest.",80,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1df2hpi/genuine_question_why_are_western_people/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1df2hpi/genuine_question_why_are_western_people/l8gdn4u

She's not having a rational reaction, she's having a reaction fueled by a lifetime of Israeli indoctrination and propaganda that probably forms her earliest memories of Jewishness. (Reality is that Judaism and Zionism are NOT the same, and it is harmful to conflate the two)

Zionists are so indoctrinated that they don't even look at the footage of this genocide, because it's easier to deny and avoid that cognitive dissonance if they don't watch. The rest of us are SEEING scalped, crushed, shot and starved children in real time. Zionists aren't.

Kamala has shown that she will uphold the status quo, and using Congolese and other African/Black countries’ suffering to bolster arguments is both ridiculous and disingenuous. She will continue to support policies that allow rich nations to go unchecked as they plunder and exploit historically vulnerable countries.

- Keeping ***exonerated inmates*** in jail because it'd disrupt the ~~slave~~ prison labor they relied on.  
- Destroying hundreds of black families by locking people up for weed (which she admitted to smoking).  
- Ruining families by locking parents up if their children had school truancies.

She failed at getting any black votes, let alone any votes at all, and pretty much ended her campaign after Tulsi (being a good Hawaiian) roasted her like the pig she is. She's being SELECTED by the (irony alert!) **Democratic** party, because she would utterly lose if any primaries were held.

Arabs / Muslims who vote or have voted in any election in the US are just like the people theyre now getting upset at. There hasn’t been a US president in the last 50 yrs that hasn’t aided in the killing of Muslims / Arabs or killed them directl. Now it takes a genocide for all of you to wake up? Every single elections ive had to hear, “why aren’t you voting? Blah blah blah blah”… my answer “ what’s the point in being part of a system that will put the next Muslim/ Arab murderer in power? 

While the Palestinian cause may be important to Muslims and Arabs - don’t expect the same level of commitment from others that aren’t either. Just like you (for those of you have been through an elections before) couldn’t even commit to your brothers and sisters before and wanted to vote because (as the sister says in the video), it was cool, cute, and a trend. Those presidents you put in office still went and killed Muslims, and that’s why today we’re dealing with the issues that we’re dealing with. 

So for any Muslim who believes that once a fake cease fire is reached, and the zionists go back to killing just 10 Palestinians instead of 100 a day so now you think it’s ok to vote again, unfortunately you didn’t learn anything.",24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1eqj48t/apparently_if_youre_propalestine_youre_antiblack/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1eqj48t/apparently_if_youre_propalestine_youre_antiblack/lhud7la

The West likes to dehumanize what they don't know. The amount of times I've seen Allah referenced as a whole other God is laughable. Most people don't know the first thing about Islam to begin with.

2023-11-28 00:45:24,Palestine,Palestine,185diib,kb1vizs,I am an American who lived in Palestine—our governments are gaslighting us.,"Ditto- I usually don't share too much to the entire Internet, but I lived in Beit Sahour (near Bethlehem) in 2009 and traveled all across the West Bank (Hebron, Ramallah, Tulkarem, Nablus, Jenin, and to some smaller towns), traveled around Israel, and even managed to visit the Gaza Strip for a week through Rafah (up and down the Strip, to Jabaliya, Beit Hanoun, and Gaza City).

The experience in Palestine was absolutely amazing, especially as an American Jew. Welcomed everywhere I went, people were genuinely friendly and willing to show us around their towns without expectation that we would pay them (the tour guide scam). So many fantastic family dinners, big spreads of food, great discussions. It was life-changing.

My most eye-opening experience was how pretty much every Palestinian would openly welcome Jews or even Israelis, but condemned the Zionist agenda that occupies Palestine. Even in Hebron when the Israeli forces started tear gassing and shooting and we all fled into a shop to hide, I was a bit shell-shocked and started to confuse Hebrew words into my Arabic, to the point where the shopkeeper obviously knew I was Hebrew-speaking when I used the Hebrew word for bread (""le5em"") instead of the Arabic word (""5ubez""- the Hebrew word meant ""meat"" even though I was trying to say ""bread""). The shopkeeper's eyes opened wide, he reached out and shook my hand, and said that anybody that would stand with Palestinians is welcome in his shop. The overwhelming amount of humanity and humility taught me lessons I'll never forget.

On the contrary, Israelis treated me great when they figured I was in their ethnic group. It changed a bit when they learned I was ethnically part-Arab. It changed a whole lot when they learned I did not agree with the occupation of Palestine, and that's when I nearly got shot...",161,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/185diib/i_am_an_american_who_lived_in_palestineour/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/185diib/i_am_an_american_who_lived_in_palestineour/kb1vizs

EDIT: [Fun facts about the Palestinian flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Palestine) to use in your defense. It has been used in its current form since the 1920s, decades before the formation of Israel. Israel made it illegal before Hamas was ever formed, in 1964. Hamas was founded in 1987. So by definition it has nothing to do with Hamas anyway. It was formed by a state that existed before Israel and Hamas even existed.

Human rights organization Amnesty International had this to say:

What makes us humans? What differentiates us from mere animals?

The ability to fight against injustice. The ability to fight back against the law of the jungle. The dignity to stand up and fight for what's right.

By dying like that, he was able to die as a human being and not as a mere animal. Not as a mere cog in the imperial war marchine. Their whole imperial arsenal had nothing that could break a man that refused to be broken.

Writing my thoughts on what Aaron might have meant because a few people here have made queries in the comments: 

I think he’s recognizing his racial identity and its roots in imperialism, genocidal settler-colonialism, and white supremacy—established yt Americans aren’t native to the U.S. and they’ve long since departed from their European roots. Colonialists are spiritually, culturally, and psychologically “landless” in a sense of having lost identity, home, heritage, and their humanity after having stolen it from another. It’s no wonder yt people are so obsessed with fetishizing cultures throughout the world. They’re chasing after a fundamental human need of origin, home, and selfhood they’ve relinquished by committing such profound evil. They don’t belong anywhere and they’ve lost any real claim to doing so. In uprooting other people they’ve uprooted themselves. Colonialists lose their right to any part of the world and systematically gridlock their descendants in the same trap. As a descendent of such people historically and a member of people currently pursuing this violence, I think Aaron likely felt all of this and was trying to stand up to it and call for finally putting it to an end.

I don’t condone or actively support self-immolation, but do respect it as an act of extreme protest. All that being said, here’s a real example of a yt person taking responsibility, having moral culpability, facing history, and not cowering from having to do so like I’ve seen in the faces of so many yt people who express discomfort, weakness, contempt, or malicious rebukes at having to do any of the above. This was an act of high courage, virtue, and pure goodness. Rest in power Aaron!! You’ve challenged the course of human history for nearly the last millennia through your most profound sacrifice!!! Here’s the finale to the rot of western colonialism, hegemony, and white supremacy!! Viva viva Palestina!!! We’re not liberating Palestine, Palestine is liberating all of us!!! Palestinian liberation is human liberation!!! Let’s keep it up for all Palestinians, all oppressed people, and for both Aaron and fellow activists who by being Brown, women, etc. go unknown to social media and the public while also having committed the act of self-immolation. FREE FREE PALESTINE!!!!! 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸",79,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1b381u7/from_aarons_will_if_a_time_comes_when/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1b381u7/from_aarons_will_if_a_time_comes_when/ksqwove

They cause violence which is used as black propaganda against the protesters and allows the American branch of the IOF - they have multiple names for them, NYPD, LAPD, etc -  to attack the previously peaceful people, beat them and destroy their lives with criminal charges.

This results in the Zionist in chief getting a chance to badly read an autocue speech to bolster Satan's smegma, or Bibi as it's known, in its campaign of terror.

These people should have their pictures all over the place so nobody ends up with a child murderer. If they are relishing in the murder of women and children what would they do to a girlfriend or wife that didn't do as they were told?

2024-09-14 16:35:36,Palestine,Palestine,1fgo4j5,ln3t79p,"What protesting, BDS movement and speaking up for Palestine got so far?","A lot of people are highly critical of the effectiveness of BDS (I realise this is not OP's message). 

It is true, typically, that the lower the level of activity, the less impact will be generated.

Protests are weaker than civil disobedience, which is weaker than direct action, which is weaker than rioting, which is weaker than political violence.

This is not to say the more violent forms are better, just that - historically - these are what cause a greater political response.

However, protests, when done effectively, can build greater awareness of problems and a growing grassroots swell of pressure for political change.

The media coverage of the Gaza crisis was so weak that for months the average person was unaware of the severity of the events taking place - and many of those who did see news, were told only the Israeli perspective on 7th October. That changed with the widespread university protests, these led to a new, bigger wave of street protests. These in turn brought the support of several well known celebrities to the cause, then individual politicians, and eventually world leaders, speaking at the United Nations. This is all building towards official recognition of Palestinian statehood.

Without the initial small-scale protests this probably would not have occurred.

BDS is the same, its pressure builds slowly and, when it reaches a certain tipping point, is capable of a rapid surge that can bring about major change. This is what happened with South Africa, and, though not guaranteed, it has the potential to do the same against Israel.

All struggles for freedom and justice against a more powerful opponent can seem hopeless at times. At present the crimes against the Palestinian people have never been worse (far more have died than even during the Nakba), but support for Palestine among the common people of the world has never been more widespread.",65,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1fgo4j5/what_protesting_bds_movement_and_speaking_up_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1fgo4j5/what_protesting_bds_movement_and_speaking_up_for/ln3t79p

The interviewers are so exaggerated and caricaturish in their manner it feels like they are playing a prank on the interviewee.

They remind me of that trope where two idiotic, trollish bully types get into a confrontation with the protagonist, but are so petulant and incompetent that they keep tripping over their words, lose track of why the reason for their confrontation and start arguing with each other; meanwhile the clever protagonist just observes and eventually slips away.

Sort of like Crabbe and Goyle, or the trolls in The Hobbit who get into an argument about how to eat Bilbo while he sneaks off and they turn to stone.

Could be a Malay from Indonesia or someone with Indonesian heritage living in Malaysia. Maybe this is something you can show to the folks at Indonesian Hospital in Gaza.

Translation:

*Atok (Grandfather), Can you cook fried rice for... hmmmph*

*(puts on Keffiyeh Bandana)*

*Ok, Let's go.*

*Start by heating up the wok until it becomes oily*

*then 5 Kilograms of cooking oil*

*then add garlic, SMASH, (smashes table) - (""cincaaaaang"") cut to pieces*

*and then stir-fry (kacau-kacau) mix-mix*

*then add 1 kilogram of chili and then, SMASH (smashes table) -  (""cincaaaaang"") cut to pieces*

*then add a piece of egg (although he said ""telur-mu"" which means ""your egg"", cheeky bugger)*

*break it and then throw (sound effects)*

*then (kacau-kacau) mix-mix (he pronounced it in a funny way, ka-chow! ka-chow!)*

*then add a ladle of vegetable, (stale) rice (he says nasi-something, that sounds like ""bestie"" could also a play of words for ""basi"" which means ""stale"". Throw (sound effects)*

*then ka-chow! ka-chow! ka-chow! ka-chow! (ladle-fighting intensifies)*

*then add oyster sauce, chili sauce, soy-sauce,*

*ADD A TABLE SPOON OF ZAQQUM!!! (When you know , you know)*

*salt, Ajinomoto (A Japanese MSG salt, though he pronounce it as Aji-no-Mantra, which is a play of words, kind of mean ""magic spell"" or ""hocus-pocus"" )*

*Then ka-chow! with FIRE until it reach the brim, ka-chow!, ka-chow!*

*and...READY*

*then throw onto a plate that's ready*

*There it is, FRIED RICE YAHUDI*

*Then - (Throws it into a bin)*

&#x200B;

""Kacau"" means ""Mix"" in Malay but in Indonesian, could also mean ""chaos"". In TikTok, this was a response to someone who seems to be an Indian-Israel simp based on her profile pic, who asked him to cook an ""Israeli Fried Rice."" His whole channel is about Fried Rice.

I started working with refugees and started studying Arabic and middle-eastern history. We had one or two seminars on Israel which was literally the opposite of all the casual propaganda we'd heard throughout our lives. The lesson was full of confused students asking questions and the lecturers barely scratched the surface and recommended ""the new historians"" from Israel.

Was most struck by Ilan Pappe's books and was absolutely horrified and went down a rabbit hole, wrote my exam on it.

Anyone who's still a zionist after everything is utterly vile and irredeemable and shouldn't be engaged with, they've shown no interest in being a part of humanity. To be a zionist is to abandon humanity or any legitimacy.

Zionists shouldn't be allowed or let into social circles. They should be shunned and isolated like or more than how the apartheid supporters in South Africa were, and any attempt at pretending like they're normal should be shut down. It was social and economical exclusion that forced them to stop their racial apartheid, they couldn't go anywhere or do anything. And they've shown what satanism they're supportive of in complete supremacist disregard for everyone and everything in the world driven by their ideology, they can't be allowed in pretending to be polite people after this.",314,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1cuy7j2/zionist_suella_braverman_gets_silent_treatment_by/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1cuy7j2/zionist_suella_braverman_gets_silent_treatment_by/l4lpge6

They’re mean. They. Are. All. Mean. Like to their core. I remember one girl shared in Chapel (our first class) how her mother spit and slammed the door on two Jehovah Witnesses and the little girl they had with them and everyone clapped. 

I stood up and asked what was wrong with them? How is this love? We sang that song all the time “And they’ll know we are Christians by our love”. I told them they were all ugly and full of hate. I was prayed over then kicked out. My childhood sucked, but I think that day was one of my happiest. Valley Christian School. Worst people ever. All white. That’s what they are, supremacists wrapped in a religion worshiping a God they made in their image. 

They’re the purity cult assholes too. Two women from that school ended up in years of therapy. One was so ashamed she got a condition called Vaginismus. Had to have surgery. Luckily the guy she married was wonderful and left the church with her. The other had been systemically raped by her father. 

It’s a sick twisted Patriarchal nightmare. You talk about grooming? THAT’S grooming. It’s a hate group and they belong on a watch list, not walking the halls of congress, running schools, companies, local, state, federal government.

Oh, and one of the most insane things? They’re virulently anti-Semitic. They just want J town to return and start the culling.

As far as I can tell, the captions are accurate. And fuck me, man, how are we losing behind the Japanese in terms of opposing imperialism and settler-colonialism?

It's a big disgrace that my native Korea that should know better from our own history are too busy chiming the American overlord's line, while the Japanese are actually trying to put up some pretense of neutrality and arbitration. Apart from the moral dimensions, even from realistic point of view, it's idiotic and self-destructive. The current South Korean simping for the pro-Zionist narrative is going to physically cost the Korean government and companies in the form of more Houthi missiles and abductions for all the Korean commercial liners passing the Gulf of Aden.

Meanwhile, this is how Japan always maintains its vastly wider network of diplomatic and commercial interests, still having some sense of independent diplomatic influence while still being a US vassal state like us. Too many Koreans think this is some sort of one-way ""Team Western world"" vs ""Evil Commie-Muslim Alliance"" thing based on our own, limited, very US-centric, wrapped view of the global geopolitics.

The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has released an audio recording of when 15-year-old Layan Hamadeh called to ask for help from a car in Gaza City.

In the recording, the teenager says: “They are shooting at us … the tank is next to me.”

Shots ring out as the teenager screams, and then nothing is heard from her. “Layan was killed and 6-year-old Hind remained trapped inside the car surrounded by the occupation tanks and soldiers,” PRCS said in a post on X.

Meanwhile, an ambulance team dispatched to the scene more than 20 hours ago hasn’t been heard from. “We still remain unaware of their fate and whether they succeeded in evacuating her or not,” the PRCS said

July 7, 2024 ","So happy about it. A lot of us voted New popular front and La France Insoumise (LFI) for their position on Palestine, on top of being the most humanist and real leftist party in France.

The official position is 2 state solution but that is just the beginning. Like Rima Hassan said, our newly minted Franco Palestinian European deputy, this is to follow international law and demand an immediate and permanent ceasefire. But ideally, she also wants one state with bi nationality in the future. But France recognising Palestine will be a huge step and pressure on Israel.

There were also talks about stopping all military contracts with Israel and prosecuting Franco-Israeli soldiers that are coming back from Gaza. France is the 2nd after USA to provide overseas soldiers to Israel.

Our country and media are insanely pro Israel, heavily censoring and attacking any pro pal voices.  Recently, Netanyahu made a president style announcement on our national TV to talk about “our victory” as westerners on Palestinians. It was disgusting.

Our LFI MPs were also the ones waving Palestinian flags in the parliament, getting sanctioned for it, and constantly talking about Palestine. They have now with a relative majority and I am very optimistic they will keep all their promises on Palestine.",39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1dxpmdo/france_elections_winners_promise_to_recognize/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1dxpmdo/france_elections_winners_promise_to_recognize/lc4fg5a

2024-05-10 06:59:03,Palestine,Palestine,1coefvf,l3edfom,"The name ""Palestine"" has existed for 3000 years","What's even more ridiculous is that there are several Holocaust survivor memoirs that explicitly mention trying to get to or wanting to go to Palestine.

Here are a few excerpts from memoirs that refer to Palestine by name:

Rescued from the Ashes (Leokadia Schmidt):
We were very sorry for Mr. Rosenpick, a very wise and cultured gentleman. He would always tell my husband, “We European Jews are condemned to extinction, but a new Jewish nation will arise in Palestine out of those who are saved and from the Jews of North and South America.”

Among the Reeds (Tammy Bottner):
There were many different sects of Jews in the city: Hassidim with their long black coats and curly sideburns, modern Reform Jews, and a Zionist community that longed for the formation of a modern Jewish state in Palestine.

...As soon as the first warmth of spring coaxed the daffodils out, we left. That is when we started our journey toward Palestine. The land of Israel was still not established, but we went anyway. We had heard about how austerely the Jews lived in Palestine.

...Eventually my cousin Miriam, Tante Paula’s daughter, who was a native of Palestine, came and vouched for us, and we were released.

...At the end of World War One, the British, victorious over the Ottoman Empire – which had fought on the German side – ousted the Turks and assumed control over much of the Middle East, including the area called Palestine.

Night (Elie Wiesel):
We also spoke often about Palestine. Their parents, like mine, had not had the courage to sell everything and emigrate while there was still time.

Alicia (Alicia Appleman-Jurman)
Eretz Israel, which the world knew as Palestine, was  governed by England under a mandate from the old League of Nations. Bevin had issued a “white paper” that drastically limited the entry of Jews into Palestine despite the fact that the English government had, in its Balfour Declaration of 1917, promised that a Jewish homeland would be developed there. The reason for this was that England desired to pacify the Arab world, which strongly opposed such a Jewish homeland. At the rate this “white paper” was allowing immigration into Palestine, we would have to wait ten years to get there, and this was, of course, out of the question.",50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1coefvf/the_name_palestine_has_existed_for_3000_years/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1coefvf/the_name_palestine_has_existed_for_3000_years/l3edfom

The people of Palestine were there and had permanent cities before Judaism even started. Then Joshua, about 600 years after Abraham, started conquering Philistine and Canaanite cities in the area. Does the battle of Jericho ring a bell? It is one of the oldest cities in the world. At that time they still didn’t have a country or a king. It was about 1000 years from Abraham to Saul, the first king of Israel. 

The ancient kingdom of Israel was ruled for a grand total of 200 years. Yet the Jews believe they have exclusive right to the land. It was land they took from other people to begin with.

Everyone at the camp is fine, no one was hurt. The police were able to arrest the arsonist. He was later released and is only being charged for ""destruction of property by means of arson"" (sorry, translated directly from German ""Sachbeschädigung durch Brandstiftung""). He has not faced charges related to hate crimes and he is, for now, a free man. The news went viral in Germany, and I heard on the radio that the prosecutor suspects anti-muslim motives.

This is a slap in the face to all pro-Palestinian voices in Germany, but it is hardly surprising when considering Germany's ongoing medial and political repression and vilification of Palestinians, Arabs and immigrants.

You can show your support to the camp by following their Instagram page [HERE](https://www.instagram.com/uniforpalestine_muc/) and leaving a message of solidarity.

Edit: I should note that I personally am not involved in the camp, nor was I there at the time of the attack. I'm just an activist based in Munich as well and know the organizers.

I've reached out in person and indirectly to people involved in protests like the one above and invariably they have shown no interest in expanding beyond simple group demos, which are better than nothing but far less than whats possible.

Worth noting that some 56 years ago in 1968, 20,000 Japanese students engaged in a full-scale battle at Shinjuku train station against the Tokyo riot police in a protest against the Vietnam war. Violence in present-day Japan would be utterly counter-productive (and serve only to tarnish all protest) but it would be nice to see the same level of passion that previous generations had for resisting warmongers.",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1gf17q1/a_demonstration_was_held_in_hachiko_square_tokyo/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1gf17q1/a_demonstration_was_held_in_hachiko_square_tokyo/luhcafe
