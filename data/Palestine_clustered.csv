&nbsp;

If you support Harris:

* We will probably get the same status quo Israel loving government we have had for the last 60+ years, but they might at least *try* to curb things.

If you support Trump:

* You will get the same situation in Israel-Gaza you have right now, but with them being told to ""finish what they started"" and to consider the nuclear option while on the phone with their leadership ""pretty much every day"" asking them to keep it going to hurt the election.

* You will see Ukraine collapse as Trump pulls aid and funding (which he withheld from Ukraine last time in office) for his buddy Putin, seeing a genocide there.

* You will get a new home-grown genocidal war against the LGBTQ+ citizenry or at the very least see them oppressed into slave-level ""rights"".

* You will see an all out war on anyone the GOP doesn't consider a ""good immigrant"".

* You will see new levels of racism and bigotry from the man who talks about burying ""fucking Mexicans"", ""vermin that are poisoning the lifeblood of the country"", hatred against Asian-Americans from the man who made popular ""kung flu"", and the ""enemy within"" that should apparently have US military used on them. All compiled with a planned Muslim ban and new religious hatred if you are not white evangelical.

* The new war on women, turning them into baby factories who can't divorce their husbands unless another man says that it is okay. Gilead is not something to which we should aspire.

Reagan used his power to influence Israeli war policy multiple times. 

Indeed, there were several instances where Reagan ordered warplanes and munitions to be delayed because they were going to be used against civilians and in ways America did not approve. 

And reportedly, the civilian casualties - particularly during the 1982 Lebanon War and when Israel attacked PLO targets - bothered him greatly and he found it deeply upsetting. Even writing of his disgust and the need to influence Israel in his diary.

For Reagan, the civilian casualties were an impetus for action as much as any other political reasons.

And Reagan wasn't the only Republican to play hardball with Israel...

Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened economic sanctions and an aid cutoff to force Israel to withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula after it invaded Egypt in 1956. 

Gerald R. Ford warned that he would re-evaluate the entire relationship in 1975 over what he considered Israel’s recalcitrance during peace talks with Egypt.

President Joe Biden said Thursday that the weekslong pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses haven’t changed his policy stance on Israel and the Middle East.

In his strongest direct remarks yet on the escalating protests, Biden criticized some of the protests as “not peaceful,” saying that they had disrupted classes and upcoming graduation ceremonies, and that vandalizing, trespassing, and occupying campus buildings wasn’t considered free speech.

“Violent protest in America is not protected. Peaceful protest is,” Biden said at the White House.

>Good morning.  Before I head to North Carolina, I wanted to speak for a few moments about what's going on on our college campuses here.  We've all seen images and they put to the test two fundamental American principles.  First is the right to free speech and for people to peacefully assemble and make their voices heard.  The second is the rule of law.  Both must be upheld.  

>We are not an authoritarian nation where we silence people or squash dissent.  The American people are heard.  In fact, peaceful protest is in the best American tradition of how Americans respond to consequential issues.  But - but - neither are we a lawless country.  We're a civil society, and order must prevail.  Throughout our history we've often faced moments like this because we are a big, diverse, free-thinking and freedom-loving nation.  In moments like this, there are always those who rush in to score political points.  But this isn't a moment for politics, it's a moment for clarity.  

>So let me be clear: peaceful protest in America - violent protest is not protected, peaceful protest is.  It's against the law when violence occurs; destroying property is not a peaceful protest it's against the law.  Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campuses, forcing the cancellation of classes and graduation, none of this is a peaceful protest.  Threatening people, intimidating people, instilling fear in people is not a peaceful protest, it's against the law.  Dissent is essential to democracy, but dissent must never lead to disorder or to denying the rights of other students can finish the semester and their college education.  

>Look, it's a matter of fairness, it's a matter of what's right.  There's the right to protest, but not the right to cause chaos.  People have the right to get an education, the right to get a degree, the right to walk across the campus safely without the fear of getting attacked.  

>Let's be clear about this as well: there should be no place on any campus, no place in America, for antisemitism or threats of violence against Jewish students.  There is no place for hate speech or violence of any kind, whether it's antisemitism or Islamophobia, or discrimination against Arab-Americans or Palestinian-Americans.  It's simply wrong. There is no place for racism in America; it's all wrong, it's unamerican.  

>I understand people have strong feelings and deep convictions.  In America, we respect the right and protect the right to express that, but it doesn't mean anything goes.  It needs to be done without violence, without destruction, without hate, and within the law.  Make no mistake, as president I will always defend free speech, and I will always be just as strong in standing up for the rule of law.  That's my responsibility to you, the American people, and my obligation to the Constitution.

>Q: 'Have the protests forced you to reconsider any policies with regard to the region?'

kg1cw3h,2024-01-02 21:56:31,politics,Israel,18x1lfb,Bernie Sanders Calls On Congress To Reject Unconditional Military Aid To Israel,"Sen. Bernie Sanders called on Congress Tuesday to reject the $10.1 billion in unconditional military aid to Israel, citing “Netanyahu’s illegal and immoral war against the Palestinian People.” 

In a statement, Sanders said the supplemental funding bill gives aid “for the right-wing Netanyahu government to continue its brutal war against the Palestinian people.” 

“Enough is enough. Congress must reject that funding.

k7xh61r,2023-11-05 14:24:43,politics,Israel,17od07z,White House frustrated by Israel’s onslaught but sees few options,"As Israel’s ground invasion of Gaza escalates, the Biden administration finds itself in a precarious position: Administration officials say Israel’s counterattack against Hamas has been too severe, too costly in civilian casualties, and lacking a coherent endgame, but they are unable to exert significant influence on America’s closest ally in the Middle East to change its course.

U.S. efforts to get Israel to scale back its counterattack in response to the Oct. 7 killings by Hamas that left at least 1,400 Israelis dead have failed or fallen short. The Biden administration [urged Israel against a ground invasion,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/10/27/us-urging-israel-rethinkg-gaza-ground-invasion/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4) privately asked it to consider proportionality in its attacks, advocated a higher priority on avoiding civilian deaths, and [called for a humanitarian pause](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/10/27/gaza-israel-humanitarian-pause/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4) — only for Israeli officials to dismiss or reject all those suggestions.

That has left the Biden administration urgently seeking to temper anger in the Arab world by making clear, publicly and privately, that the United States is deeply distressed by the suffering in Gaza, a densely populated land strip of more than 2 million people, about half of whom are children. But there is little indication that Arab leaders are moved by these assurances, leaving the shape of the Middle East after the war — and the U.S. role in it — highly uncertain.

“It’s important for the administration to be loud in their concern for the humanitarian toll,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “I understand they don’t want to open up any public space between the United States and Israel. But if we all want to prevent another front from opening up and we want the Gulf states to be part of the reconstruction of Gaza, then we need to make as clear as possible that the United States is prioritizing reduction in civilian harm.”

Murphy recently issued a public statement declaring the current rate of civilian deaths “unacceptable” and urging Israel to shift course. “The administration has been pressing really hard privately,” Murphy said. “And I think they’ve got to be even louder publicly in their concerns about the civilian cost, even while they support Israel’s ability to continue to perpetuate the war.”

The White House declined to comment for this article. A spokesperson pointed to previous comments by national security adviser Jake Sullivan saying that Hamas’s use of Palestinian civilians as human shields does not lessen Israel’s responsibility to do everything possible to minimize civilian casualties.

> WASHINGTON - Sen. Bernie Sanders is preparing several resolutions that would stop more than $20 billion in U.S. arms sales to Israel, a longshot effort but the most substantive pushback yet from Congress over the devastation in Gaza ahead of the first year anniversary of the Israel-Hamas war.

> In a letter to Senate colleagues on Wednesday, Sanders said the U.S. cannot be &quot;Complicit in this humanitarian disaster.&quot; The action would force an eventual vote to block the arms sales to Israel, though majority passage is highly unlikely.

> As the war grinds toward a second year, and with the outcome of President Joe Biden&#039;s efforts to broker a cease-fire deal and hostage release uncertain, the resolutions from Sanders would seek to reign in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#039;s assault on Gaza.

How they saw children in the playground blown to bits.

When I brought this up in school I was severely chastised - America doesn't do that. Other countries did, we do not. 

Of all things, I watched the new Pinocchio, and in the beginning it was explained how Gepetto's son had died - the American bombers dropped their load before returning. 

Apparently it is now ok to admit this.

Part of me wants to laugh, but the other part feels frustrated that there are Americans who think this way.

They are a vocal minority no doubt, but it's still concerning.

Because it's apparent that these people have no regard for important historical context, for the various factors that have all contributed, over the course of almost a century now, to the current conflict in Israel and consequently, across the middle East. 

To quote a meandering, arrogant, pseudo-intellectual conservative by the name of Ben Shapiro, ""facts don't care about your feelings.""

And that's all these types of comments are informed by, feelings.

You're ignoring or you are ignorant of a complicated history in the Middle East stretching back to the Balfour Declaration, the end of WW1, while some historians would argue, the late 19th century author/journalist, Theodore Herzl and his publication of ""Der Judenstaat.""

You're ignoring decades of geopolitics, world affairs and international relations, an Israeli/Palestinian conflict that has endured for almost a century now, the history of the Iranian revolution and all that's taken place since, a persistent conflict in Syria that has become a theater of war and hostilities for multiple nations across the globe, Middle East affairs in general, The United Nations involvement in some of these conflicts, Israel's more recent political history involving a strong man persona who has built a far right coalition in Israel that supports the collective punishment of the Palestinian people, as well as the gradual disposession of their land, and of course, America's own historical and ongoing foreign relationship with these nations and their political affairs.

Joe Biden is just a miniscule piece of the puzzle in relationship to this broader regional conflict

You're also ignoring the role that past administration's have played in either exacerbating these conflicts, in establishing or dismantling alliances, in making compromises and in some cases, failed attempts at peace efforts. 

Joe Biden did not start WWIII, in fact, conservatives seem to be more interested in encouraging such a war than anything else, so they can justify such a profoundly ignorant accusation that Joe Biden, equal parts dementia and criminal mastermind, is responsible for every conceivable global conflict. 

The actions that some of these social media foreign policy experts are vaguely advocating for, are not going to change the important fact that this regional conflict and its history are complicated. There is no catch-all solution, Joe Biden cannot flick his wrist and change its trajectory. 

It's also a multinational conflict that requires comprehensive considerations from our leaders before any action can be taken. 

Biden has communicated his support for Palestinian civilians and refugees, but the U.S. and Israel have been politically and strategically entangled for so long, that it's not as simple as just letting go of an important ally, or threatening to, on the off chance that it doesn't make things even more complicated. Netanyahu doesn't respond to aggressive maneuvers very diplomatically. Keep in mind also, that Netanyahu has benefitted throughout his political career from playing the strongman and sustaining a volatile and violent conflict in the region to remain in power. 

The U.S has leverage over the Israeli government, but it works both ways. Especially when Netanyahu has recently made a bigger political ally out of the Republican party, who cares little for the plight of Palestinians because many conservatives have simply lumped them in with all terrorists. Any effort from Biden to push hard against Netanyahu, will be met with an equal, but opposite reaction. And you better believe Republicans will capitalize off of it and make it part of their 2024 platform. But let's not go too far off tangent.

Biden is caught between a rock and a hard place. There's quite a few Conservatives who tend to become isolationists when it's beneficial for them, but blame Biden for both not doing enough or getting involved in most any capacity, there's no winning strategy here. The reality is, it's a series of historical, previous relations with countries like Israel and Iran in particular that put us in this foreign policy predicament, not the actions of a single current president. The U.S. and the middle East are separated by a vast expanse of ocean, but are regions tied together by these past alliances, conflicts, political and strategic relationships, ties that existed well before Biden took office. In other words, this dilemma, is likely one that any president would have had to face coming into this most recent term. This should be obvious enough, but for some, it isn't

I would suggest you incendiary critics inform yourselves and try, at the very least, to reflect on your motivations here, your prejudices and preconceptions, where you obtained them, and why you support these kinds of very short sighted, unnuanced, blatantly partisan and misinformed oversimplifications.

I would suggest it, yes, but I know such a suggestion would go over your head, or would fall on deaf ears. 

This is what I've come to expect of a vocal minority of agitators, contrarians and fanatics who are mindlessly adherent to one group, party, ideology or person, speaking in black and white terms, generalizations and preconceived ideas riddled with bias and prejudice,

Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), an independent who caucuses with Democrats, is forcing the politically tricky vote using a mechanism in U.S. foreign assistance law that requires the State Department to look into human rights practices of nations receiving U.S. aid. If passed, the resolution would require the department to produce a report within 30 days about any potential abuses and how U.S. weapons have been used in Gaza.

The resolution would not alter U.S. aid to Israel, but it is still facing opposition from the Biden administration and many Democrats, who have raised concerns about the message the vote would send.

“We are trying to call attention to some unpleasant realities that I think a lot of people would prefer not to deal with,” Sanders said in an interview.

>""Debate about whether U.S. security assistance to foreign countries should be conditioned upon human rights criteria discounts a simple fact. U.S. law is clear: all countries receiving U.S. aid must meet human rights standards, and countries violating these standards are liable to be sanctioned and ineligible for U.S. funding:  
>  
>The Foreign Assistance Act (P.L. 87–195) regulates all forms of U.S. assistance to foreign countries. It states that no assistance may be provided to a country “which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.”  
>  
>The Arms Export Control Act (P.L. 90–629) regulates U.S. military assistance and sales to foreign countries. It states that the United States can furnish weapons to foreign countries “solely for internal security, for legitimate self-defense,” and for a few other limited purposes. No credits, guarantees, sales, or deliveries of weapons can be given to a country if it is “in substantial violation” of these purposes.  
>  
>The Leahy Laws require the Departments of State and Defense to vet individual military units and individuals before they are eligible to receive U.S. equipment or training. The Department of State version of the law states that no form of assistance can be provided “to any unit of the security forces” committing “a gross violation of human rights.” The Department of Defense version states that no training or equipment can be given to a military unit that “has committed a gross violation of human rights.”  
>  
>Another indisputable fact is that the United States has placed conditions on other countries’ FMF. For example, in the FY2021 budget, $225 million of $1.3 billion in FMF for Egypt is withheld from obligation until the Department of State certifies that Egypt is “taking sustained and effective steps” to strengthen human rights.  
>  
>However, when it comes to Israel, additional conditions do not apply and general human rights laws are almost never adhered to. Furthermore, weapons flows to Israel are much less transparent than those to other countries, making implementation of these laws more difficult.

So how the fuck are they continuing to get billions of US tax dollars every year?

And asking for more billions as they're committing ethnic cleansing and war crimes under the pretext of ""self-defense""?

But if anyone questions the arrangement, they're called anti-Semitic or pro-terrorism by AIPAC and the pro-Israel lobby.

Anti-Semitism is an actual problem, and it is disgusting and psychopathic behavior to conflate opposition to Israel's apartheid, ethnic cleansing, and war crimes (illegally funded with [billions of our tax dollars](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2023-10-10/how-much-aid-does-the-u-s-give-to-israel)) with opposition to Jewish people generally.

They use accusations of anti-Semitism to shut down legitimate criticism and debate.

The American people shouldn't tolerate being bullied into silence (and into violating our own laws) by the lobbyists for a foreign government when they're using our tax dollars to fund apartheid, war crimes, and ethnic cleansing abroad, which inevitably blows back on us and our troops as well.","  it is illegal for us foreign aid to go to a country or military  which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.       debate about whether u.s. security assistance to foreign countries should be conditioned upon human rights criteria discounts a simple fact. u.s. law is clear  all countries receiving u.s. aid must meet human rights standards, and countries violating these standards are liable to be sanctioned and ineligible for u.s. funding         the foreign assistance act  p.l. 87 195  regulates all forms of u.s. assistance to foreign countries. it states that no assistance may be provided to a country  which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.         the arms export control act  p.l. 90 629  regulates u.s. military assistance and sales to foreign countries. it states that the united states can furnish weapons to foreign countries  solely for internal security, for legitimate self defense,  and for a few other limited purposes. no credits, guarantees, sales, or deliveries of weapons can be given to a country if it is  in substantial violation  of these purposes.        the leahy laws require the departments of state and defense to vet individual military units and individuals before they are eligible to receive u.s. equipment or training. the department of state version of the law states that no form of assistance can be provided  to any unit of the security forces  committing  a gross violation of human rights.  the department of defense version states that no training or equipment can be given to a military unit that  has committed a gross violation of human rights.         another indisputable fact is that the united states has placed conditions on other countries  fmf. for example, in the fy2021 budget,  225 million of  1.3 billion in fmf for egypt is withheld from obligation until the department of state certifies that egypt is  taking sustained and effective steps  to strengthen human rights.        however, when it comes to israel, additional conditions do not apply and general human rights laws are almost never adhered to. furthermore, weapons flows to israel are much less transparent than those to other countries, making implementation of these laws more difficult.        amnesty international  israeli human rights organizations including b tselem and yesh din  prominent israelis including ehud barak  literal desmond tutu and other prominent south africans  un investigators  and human rights watch have all called israel s treatment of the palestinians apartheid, which is a crime against humanity.                 so how the fuck are they continuing to get billions of us tax dollars every year?  and asking for more billions as they re committing ethnic cleansing and war crimes under the pretext of  self defense ?  but if anyone questions the arrangement, they re called anti semitic or pro terrorism by aipac and the pro israel lobby.  anti semitism is an actual problem, and it is disgusting and psychopathic behavior to conflate opposition to israel s apartheid, ethnic cleansing, and war crimes  illegally funded with  billions of our tax dollars   with opposition to jewish people generally.  they use accusations of anti semitism to shut down legitimate criticism and debate.  the american people shouldn t tolerate being bullied into silence  and into violating our own laws  by the lobbyists for a foreign government when they re using our tax dollars to fund apartheid, war crimes, and ethnic cleansing abroad, which inevitably blows back on us and our troops as well.","illegal us foreign aid go country military engages consistent pattern gross violations internationally recognized human rights. debate whether u.s. security assistance foreign countries conditioned upon human rights criteria discounts simple fact. u.s. law clear countries receiving u.s. aid must meet human rights standards, countries violating standards liable sanctioned ineligible u.s. funding foreign assistance act p.l. 87 195 regulates forms u.s. assistance foreign countries. states assistance may provided country engages consistent pattern gross violations internationally recognized human rights. arms export control act p.l. 90 629 regulates u.s. military assistance sales foreign countries. states united states furnish weapons foreign countries solely internal security, legitimate self defense, limited purposes. credits, guarantees, sales, deliveries weapons given country substantial violation purposes. leahy laws require departments state defense vet individual military units individuals eligible receive u.s. equipment training. department state version law states form assistance provided unit security forces committing gross violation human rights. department defense version states training equipment given military unit committed gross violation human rights. another indisputable fact united states placed conditions countries fmf. example, fy2021 budget, 225 million 1.3 billion fmf egypt withheld obligation department state certifies egypt taking sustained effective steps strengthen human rights. however, comes israel, additional conditions apply general human rights laws almost never adhered to. furthermore, weapons flows israel much less transparent countries, making implementation laws difficult. amnesty international israeli human rights organizations including b tselem yesh din prominent israelis including ehud barak literal desmond tutu prominent south africans un investigators human rights watch called israel treatment palestinians apartheid, crime humanity. fuck continuing get billions us tax dollars every year?

kuu6sr4,2024-03-14 14:21:30,politics,Israel,1bembli,Schumer to call for ‘new election’ in Israel in scathing speech on Netanyahu,"Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) will call for the Israeli government to hold new elections in a speech warning that Israel risked becoming an international “pariah” under the leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing cabinet.

Schumer, the highest-ranking Jewish official in the United States and a staunch ally of Israel’s, is expected to say he thinks Israelis understand “better than anybody that Israel cannot hope to succeed as a pariah opposed by the rest of the world” and would choose better leaders if elections were held.

“I believe that holding a new election once the war starts to wind down would give Israelis an opportunity to express their vision for the postwar future,” Schumer will say in a speech on the Senate floor Thursday, according to prepared remarks that did not set an exact timeline for a new election.

The call marks the clearest signal to Israel yet that frustrations over Netanyahu’s handling of the war in Gaza are boiling over, and have reached the highest echelons of the U.S. government.

President Biden has frequently expressed frustration with Netanyahu in recent months, but has never publicly suggested that Israelis replace him. The prime minister is deeply unpopular at home after the Hamas attack of Oct. 7, and has tangled with U.S. officials over his hampering of humanitarian aid into Gaza and his stated desire to conduct a ground invasion in the crowded city of Rafah, which the United States thinks would lead to an unacceptably high level of civilian casualties. He’s also explicitly rejected U.S. entreaties to discuss a pathway to a two-state solution.

He failed to on Oct 7th. He’s continuing to fail now and making Israel even less safe than before the 7th with his forced starvation of civilians and wanton killing of women and children.

They should’ve been fighting in the tunnels. If you really just wanted Hamas you flush out those damn tunnels, collapse it as you push thru, and pick off guys as they resurface. Probably find hostages and destroy weapon caches that way too.  Take bomb sniffing robots and little drones down there if you’re worried about booby traps. That’s there entire support system and guess what, you would avoid all these massive civilian casualties. But they waste time recklessly bombing and bulldozing and shooting people scrambling for aid.

k82avz7,2023-11-06 13:03:08,politics,Israel,17oyylt,Bernie Sanders says he hopes Israel rids of Netanyahu,"I think it's likely.  He's already in a power-sharing ""unity"" government with one of his rivals, and as Bernie says, his poll numbers are way down.

Not only was this a big fuck up by his government in getting caught by surprise, it's a result of Netanyahu's entire strategy around Hamas, as he [said](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-09/ty-article/.premium/another-concept-implodes-israel-cant-be-managed-by-a-criminal-defendant/0000018b-1382-d2fc-a59f-d39b5dbf0000):

> Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas

What happened was:

* Netanyahu was PM for 14 years, almost continuously, running on security as his main issue.  And the most recent government (before the unity government created after the attacks) was the most right wing in Israel's history.

* He is against a two state solution.  The main reason is not wanting to give up land/settlements on the West Bank.  Pumping up Hamas and undermining the Palestinian Authority keeps Palestinians divided, which undercuts any chance for a two state solution.  It also is a powerful argument against a Palestinian state - ""how can you ask us to leave the West Bank, look what happened when we left Gaza""

* He proceeded with normalization with Arab states without concessions (or with symbolic concessions) to the Palestinians, on the basis that the Palestinians can't interrupt that process (and the other Arab states don't love Hamas either, they wanna be respectable).

* Did other actions - more settlements, talk of annexing ""Area C"", embassy in Jerusalem, etc - that Israel/the US balked at on the basis of not wanting to piss the Palestinians off.

* Got closer to Russia, have a military industrial complex that does things like sell spyware to questionable foreign countries

* This was based on the idea that Hamas isn't *really* a big threat.  Israel has the blockade and the Iron Dome, they can (to use some buzzwords) ""shrink the conflict"" to the level of flare-ups every few years, Hamas fires some shitty rockets that don't kill anyone and Israel ""mows the grass"" in retaliation and cuts down Hamas's operational capabilities.  Enough to keep people scared, not enough to do real damage.

* Because the entire strategy is based on Hamas not being a big threat - you see what you want to see.

It's telling, by the way, that part of why Gaza was lightly defended was that troops were redeployed to the West Bank.  To defend settlers - in particular, the ""price tag"" extremists who are *looking for* a fight with Palestinians.  Microcosm of how Netanyahu was willing to trade off the danger of Hamas for territorial aggrandizement in the West Bank.","i think it s likely.  he s already in a power sharing  unity  government with one of his rivals, and as bernie says, his poll numbers are way down.  not only was this a big fuck up by his government in getting caught by surprise, it s a result of netanyahu s entire strategy around hamas, as he  said      anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a palestinian state has to support bolstering hamas and transferring money to hamas  what happened was     netanyahu was pm for 14 years, almost continuously, running on security as his main issue.  and the most recent government  before the unity government created after the attacks  was the most right wing in israel s history.    he is against a two state solution.  the main reason is not wanting to give up land settlements on the west bank.  pumping up hamas and undermining the palestinian authority keeps palestinians divided, which undercuts any chance for a two state solution.  it also is a powerful argument against a palestinian state    how can you ask us to leave the west bank, look what happened when we left gaza     he proceeded with normalization with arab states without concessions  or with symbolic concessions  to the palestinians, on the basis that the palestinians can t interrupt that process  and the other arab states don t love hamas either, they wanna be respectable .    did other actions   more settlements, talk of annexing  area c , embassy in jerusalem, etc   that israel the us balked at on the basis of not wanting to piss the palestinians off.    got closer to russia, have a military industrial complex that does things like sell spyware to questionable foreign countries    this was based on the idea that hamas isn t  really  a big threat.  israel has the blockade and the iron dome, they can  to use some buzzwords   shrink the conflict  to the level of flare ups every few years, hamas fires some shitty rockets that don t kill anyone and israel  mows the grass  in retaliation and cuts down hamas s operational capabilities.  enough to keep people scared, not enough to do real damage.    because the entire strategy is based on hamas not being a big threat   you see what you want to see.  it s telling, by the way, that part of why gaza was lightly defended was that troops were redeployed to the west bank.  to defend settlers   in particular, the  price tag  extremists who are  looking for  a fight with palestinians.  microcosm of how netanyahu was willing to trade off the danger of hamas for territorial aggrandizement in the west bank.","think likely. already power sharing unity government one rivals, bernie says, poll numbers way down. big fuck government getting caught surprise, result netanyahu entire strategy around hamas, said anyone wants thwart establishment palestinian state support bolstering hamas transferring money hamas happened netanyahu pm 14 years, almost continuously, running security main issue. recent government unity government created attacks right wing israel history. two state solution. main reason wanting give land settlements west bank. pumping hamas undermining palestinian authority keeps palestinians divided, undercuts chance two state solution. also powerful argument palestinian state ask us leave west bank, look happened left gaza proceeded normalization arab states without concessions symbolic concessions palestinians, basis palestinians interrupt process arab states love hamas either, wanna respectable . actions settlements, talk annexing area c , embassy jerusalem, etc israel us balked basis wanting piss palestinians off. got closer russia, military industrial complex things like sell spyware questionable foreign countries based idea hamas really big threat. israel blockade iron dome, use buzzwords shrink conflict level flare ups every years, hamas fires shitty rockets kill anyone israel mows grass retaliation cuts hamas operational capabilities. enough keep people scared, enough real damage. entire strategy based hamas big threat see want see. telling, way, part gaza lightly defended troops redeployed west bank. defend settlers particular, price tag extremists looking fight palestinians. microcosm netanyahu willing trade danger hamas territorial aggrandizement west bank.",102,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/17oyylt/bernie_sanders_says_he_hopes_israel_rids_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/17oyylt/bernie_sanders_says_he_hopes_israel_rids_of/k82avz7,47.64727011494253,-0.0434782608695652,0,1,0

- Green Party candidate Jill Stein's running mate is Butch Ware, a history professor at UC Santa Barbara who focuses on ""race, religion and revolutionary thought.""   He also goes by Bilal Ware.    

- Apparently Ware's side gig is performing in a hip-hop group called ""Slum Prophecy.""   

- Slum Prophecy released an album in the summer of 2024 called ""Aqsa flood."" Which is a variation on Hamas' term for the October 7 attacks. (Al-Aqsa flood)   The album has songs titled ""Intifada"" and ""Kill shot (pick them off)"" , and the album art features an inverted red triangle, which is a common symbol used by pro-palestinian protesters.

We still have a few weeks to hear sentencing, and he will undoubtedly appeal, which could last well into 2025.

But that's not what is important today.

This IS history. Polling saying voters are partisan and unmoved doesn't make it any less significant.

For starters, it's not a ""hush money"" case, as the media has latched onto. It's an *election interference* case, and these are *felonies.*

He worked to illegally cover up stories that could have easily swung the 2016 election, which was won by a few thousand votes in a few states, and could have altered the course of American history. It encapsulates everything about Trump and is the beginning to his criminal history saga regarding the Presidency.

It is hopefully only the beginning of his criminal accountability, and a necessary step forward for democracy, the rule of law, and us as a country.

In summary, I'm opening up some fine bourbon tonight.","  convicted felon donald trump    we still have a few weeks to hear sentencing, and he will undoubtedly appeal, which could last well into 2025.  but that s not what is important today.  this is history. polling saying voters are partisan and unmoved doesn t make it any less significant.  for starters, it s not a  hush money  case, as the media has latched onto. it s an  election interference  case, and these are  felonies.   he worked to illegally cover up stories that could have easily swung the 2016 election, which was won by a few thousand votes in a few states, and could have altered the course of american history. it encapsulates everything about trump and is the beginning to his criminal history saga regarding the presidency.  it is hopefully only the beginning of his criminal accountability, and a necessary step forward for democracy, the rule of law, and us as a country.  in summary, i m opening up some fine bourbon tonight.","convicted felon donald trump still weeks hear sentencing, undoubtedly appeal, could last well 2025. important today. history. polling saying voters partisan unmoved make less significant. starters, hush money case, media latched onto. election interference case, felonies. worked illegally cover stories could easily swung 2016 election, thousand votes states, could altered course american history. encapsulates everything trump beginning criminal history saga regarding presidency. hopefully beginning criminal accountability, necessary step forward democracy, rule law, us country. summary, opening fine bourbon tonight.",6851,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1d4emcb/megathread_former_us_president_donald_trump/,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1d4emcb/megathread_former_us_president_donald_trump/l6dqrc0,40.839877300613495,-0.0122699386503067,2,0,-1

That's it. Really. Israel's worth as a ""Holy Land"" steward is entirely dependent on the religiousness of US voters and said voters' ability to swing. It was and is still *overwhelming,* but has been in decline for decades. What's more, what's left of religion have been getting more extreme (and less swing,) we're starting to see Israel's worth erode. Also why we start seeing anti-*Israeli* protests manifest first and most commonly amongst higher education.

If not a ""Holy Land"" steward, Israel in reality sits in a geopolitically useless area of no interest to us. US strategic interests have been for decades in the Persian Gulf for oil and secondarily the Bosphorus to contain Russia.

Israel contributes nothing to either of these interests. It simply can't send its military anywhere since nobody likes it enough to ever give it access into, let alone through, their territory. And considering we don't care about any of Israel's neighbors outside the Sauds, Israel is effectively useless to us.

The reddit hivemind is just WoW! Nobody wants to see children killed except jihadist because in their mind killing the infidel with collateral damage is acceptable as the collateral damage (civilians) go to heaven. 


For all you 200-1 ratio and Israel is the bad guy suggest a way to have peace when your opponent openly says that the only peace possible is death to all jews. For you westerners that are shocked by the horror of war against a rat that binds itself to innocent children, what lengths would you go to protect your children? Why shouldn’t Israel be allowed to protect its children in any way they see fit. 

Until the muslim community doesn’t take charge of eliminating jihadist extremists we will never have peace because one side doesn’t want it. Look, I don’t want to see children die. No rational ppl want to see children die but Jihadist have shown us over and over that for them it’s ok. Doesn’t mean it should be ok for us also, but if I have to choose between my children and theirs, I choose mine.


Downvote me to hell if you want but go walk a mile in an Israeli shoe before you label them as monsters. They don’t want war as much as we don’t, they just have no more options.

> The Big Lie is just that: a big lie. In America, if you lose, you accept the results. You follow the Constitution. You try again. You don’t call facts ‘fake’ and then try to bring down the American experiment just because you’re unhappy. That’s not statesmanship. That’s not statesmanship, that’s selfishness. That’s not democracy, it’s the denial of the right to vote. It suppresses. It subjugates. The denial of full and free and fair elections is the most un-American thing that any of us can imagine, the most undemocratic, the most unpatriotic, and yet, sadly, not unprecedented.
> 
> So hear me clearly: There is an unfolding assault taking place in America today—an attempt to suppress and subvert the right to vote in fair and free elections, an assault on democracy, an assault on liberty, an assault on who we are—who we are as Americans. For, make no mistake, bullies and merchants of fear and peddlers of lies are threatening the very foundation of our country. It gives me no pleasure to say this. I never thought in my entire career I’d ever have to say it. But I swore an oath to you, to God—to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. And that’s an oath that forms a sacred trust to defend America against all threats both foreign and domestic.

> The assault on free and fair elections is just such a threat, literally.

He should have just said social media, because had he said “boomers and Facebook” instead of “Young folks and Tik Tok,” the internet would agree with him. 


Facebook, Twitter/X, Tik Tok, Reddit, all of them have algorithms to keep you enraged and engaged. Social media destroys any nuance to a situation and folks have to make absolute stands on one side or the other or be attacked mercilessly for it.

There are more than two positions here and it’s vital we keep saying that so we don’t turn into monsters with perceived righteousness. 

I stand with innocent people who are dying in this senseless war. Doesn’t matter where they were born, what religion they are. Doesn’t matter if they are young or old. Doesn’t matter how affluent or poor they are. I care about those trapped and being used as physical and political shields and weapons in this war. I hate that people’s deaths are being used to confuse, enrage, and radicalise the general public. 

I care about making sure people aren’t exterminated for simply existing, which both sides are being pushed to believe and support. 

I do not stand with Hamas. I do not stand with Netanyahu and the actions of his government. I think both of them are exacerbating this war and uninterested in peace. I think they are both dangerous to the security of the globe.

I do not replace *Hamas* with *Palestinian* or *Netanyahu* with *Israel.*

And I don’t conflate Israel with Judaism. 

That is wrong and I won’t do it.

You can be critical of Netanyahu and the actions of his government and not be anti-Semitic. You can say Hamas needs to be removed from power forever and power base destroyed and not be Islamaphobic. 

There are very few good players in any of this right now and I refuse to be told that I *have* to support one of the insane position of propaganda that is being pushed to us.

- Biden administration says it is outraged and that it will talk to the Netanyahu administration.

- Israel officials will say that it was a mistake (even through it was 3 separate aid trucks in different regions of the de-militarized area and sure does look like a precision strike).

- Israel will say that there were targets in the area and somehow will justify the strikes.

- about 6 months will pass and they Israel administration will admit that no credible targets were in the area and it was an on purpose strike while at the same time attempting to justify striking clearly marked aid vehicles.

- no consequences will be placed on the Israeli administration and they will move on to the next atrocity. Rinse & repeat.

lun5ylh,2024-10-31 03:42:18,politics,Israel,1gg5jdf,How can I vote for Kamala Harris if she supports Israel’s war? Here is my answer,"Here's my answer.

These ""protest votes"" against Harris are a tad unnerving considering the alternative.

In regards to the conflict in Israel, Harris has been vocal about a cease fire, she's openly expressed sympathy for innocent civilians in Gaza, she even refused to show up for Netanyahu's performance in Congress recently, performance being the key word there.

Donald Trump however, has an entirely different record as president, one that we can point to, and one that illustrates his own self-serving agenda and hardline stance on the war in Gaza. 

Trump cozied up to Netanyahu, and like he has with several contentious world leaders, Trump caved in to Bibi's political pressures.

Let me preface this by saying, I'm an American Jew myself, with Ashkenazi heritage no less, but I've spent time trying to understand this conflict and its complicated history from multiple historical perspectives. 

I don't take an indiscriminate stance on this war, my views are more nuanced, so I understand that not all Palestinians, nor are all Israelis a monolith. I understand that this conflict didn't begin on October 7th. I can sympathize with Palestinians who have suffered under military occupation, from collective punishment and the dispossession of their land. I can also sympathize with the plight of Jews who suffered from violent pogroms and almost lost their ethnic and national identity as a result of the Jewish diaspora.

I also understand that the two have been engaged in a cycle of violent conflict over land since the end of WWI after the signing of the Balfour Declaration. Some historians might argue it stretches back to the late nineteenth century as ""Zionism out of despair"" became a fledgling movement. Some argue that this conflict began in the mid-20th century, but that ignores decades of history leading up to that moment in time. 

Nevertheless, I can condemn both Hamas (and adjacent terror groups) and Netanyahu as it relates to the current state of the conflict in the region. Netanyahu has made it clear that a two state solution is no solution at all, while Hamas and its allies have also been unrelenting and undeniably share the blame in perpetuating this decades-long bloody conflict. A stalemate that has cost countless lives.

That being said, Trump's record indicates that not only is he willing to take an indiscriminate stance on this war that he likely knows next to nothing about, but he's willing to do it merely because he thinks its what's best for him politically.

Believe it or not, Trump is responsible for escalating multiple conflicts in the Middle East, some of which the U.S. military was involved. 

When it comes to his staunch Pro Israel record as president, Trump acknowledged Israel's controversial annexation of Golan Heights, and in December of 2017, formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and stated that the American embassy would be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

This act alone only heightened tensions in the region and weakened the U.S.'s capacity to act as a peace negotiator between Palestinians and Israelis. Such a move was a capitulation to Israeli leaders. While Trump, or more likely his advisors, understood the move was one that would garner them more support from their Christian voters who only see Jews as a means to a biblical end, quite literally mind you.

What's more, Trump's ""Middle East peace plan"" was poorly contrived, amateurish, and a step *away* from peace in the region. In fact, as foreign policy goes, it was more political theater than anything else as it also happened to coincide with his re-election campaign. This plan in particular also weakened our position as peace brokers in the region.

It's also important to note, that Donald Trump, by his very nature, doesn't have any specific foreign policy or political philosophy. His only philosophy is ""what's best for me?""

So his rhetoric can change at any moment depending on what's best for his political career. It should also be noted, that his rhetoric shifted temporarily after Netanyahu acknowledged Biden's win in 2020. Trump's penchant for holding grudges and his vindictive nature can also sometimes alter his public mood or his rhetoric. He's like a child really.

But that hasn't stopped him from labeling all pro Palestinian protestors as ""radicals.""

Speaking directly to the pro Palestinian movement, Trump reportedly said,

> “Well, if you get me elected, and you should really be doing this, if you get me reelected, we’re going to set that movement back 25 or 30 years,”

Trump may have offhandedly criticized Israel once or twice during this conflict, but he's quickly backpedaled with statements like, they ""have to have a victory.""

Because Trump also sees everything through a ratings lens, he's tastelessly claimed that Israel is ""absolutely losing the PR war.""

Trump hasn't laid out a plan for addressing the war in Israel if he wins a second term. But Trump's son-in-law and former nepokid, Middle East adviser, Jared Kushner, recently suggested that Gaza’s current borders can be redrawn in direct contradiction with current U.S. policy.

> “Gaza’s waterfront property could be very valuable,” Kushner said

It's likely that Trump's advisors have cautioned him against speaking out about the war, but that hasn't kept him from stigmatizing Palestinians and pro Palestinian protestors.

Also keep in mind Trump's history of bigoted remarks and actions taken against Muslims/the Arab world.

Before his presidency, Trump suggested multiple times that the U.S. has a ""Muslim problem."" He even called for the surveillance of Muslims and Muslim communities.

In 2015, he said he will ""look at"" closing mosques.

He defended warantless searches of American Muslims.

Trump once said he would “certainly implement” a database system to track Muslims and encouraged a Muslim registry

He called for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S.""

He's called Muslims ""sick people.""

Trump appointed Steve Bannon as his chief strategist. Bannon once claimed that “the Judeo-Christian west” is engaged in a “global war” against “jihadist Islamic fascism.”

Then there's Trump's first ""Muslim ban"", an executive order banning Syrian refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries.

Trump issued multiple iterations of his Muslim ban after that, including one that barred foreign nationals from eight countries.

Throughout his presidency, Trump reiterated the need for a Muslim ban and extreme vetting process and claimed that crime spikes were the result of ""radical islamic terror.""

While on Twitter, Trump also retweeted posts from an anti-muslim hate group.

And to add to this, let's not forget the recent ""rally"" in MSG that included a long list of speakers spouting extreme, xenophobic rhetoric.

All that being said, what I'm getting at here is, based on both of their records, who do you think is more likely to provide Palestinians with a greater measure of support and acknowledgement as president?","here s my answer.  these  protest votes  against harris are a tad unnerving considering the alternative.  in regards to the conflict in israel, harris has been vocal about a cease fire,

I don’t think people understand what it means to walk up to our friends who have lost many loved ones in this war and tell them “don’t you understand, it can actually be worse?”. Have a fucking heart. What’s worse than them being killed indiscriminately and forcibly moved from their homes that they can’t return to? Nuking the place? Nuke it already then. You think they care if their death is slow or fast? Accelerate? Are you all serious? And even locally - you think the dems really have shown that they would protect us?

You want to bring the Arab vote, then just acknowledge that the dems can do better - you don’t have to say Trump will be worse. All people have to do is say - we are stuck in a shitty position because the Middle East is a fucked up place and our end goal is to stop this war (and yes that is different rhetoric than what is currently being said , which heavily implies the status quo is continuing). 

Arabs have felt betrayed by the democrats have been marginalised over and over again - shushed, educated on how “Trump is bad for us”, representatives who have said nothing walked out of rallies where fucking Liz Cheney was honoured (in the only state where the Arab vote matters). 

The dems have made it clear that they don’t give a crap about the Arab vote. Okay. So why all this drama? You either care and cater to the market you want or Let them be. Go pick up the voters republicans shat out of their party, the likes  of Liz Cheney instead who are apparently more worth your time.

While tensions between Bibi and the White House flare, Capitol Hill progressives are making the case for breaking up Israel and Ukraine aid, Semafor’s Kadia Goba reports.

In a new video set to be released this week, Rep. Jamaal Bowman says he’s opposed to the Senate’s $95 billion foreign aid bill, which combines support for the two countries, due to Israel’s conduct in Gaza.

“We cannot stand by and allow children to be bombed, to die of starvation, or to see their entire families wiped out,” he says, according to a partial transcript shared with Semafor. “That is why I cannot support the Senate’s aid bill, and why we need a standalone vote on Ukraine funding.”

Bowman isn’t alone. In recent weeks a progressive limelights including Reps. Pramila Jayapal, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Summer Lee have suggested they would not join a discharge petition to force a vote on the Senate bill, which is currently stalled in the House, over their concerns about Israel.

“I keep saying to the administration, give us a standalone on Ukraine,” Rep. Delia Ramirez, Ill., told Semafor last week.

Democrats have generally resisted the idea of separating the aid packages, which Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has floated repeatedly. But there is now clearly a left-right coalition that favors it.

If Shapiro was really as racist against Palestinians as claimed, the author could do us the favour of linking in full the article they claim to have been so awful rather than a contextless excerpt.

koc66a5,2024-01-31 21:04:53,politics,Palestine,1afsmys,US ‘could recognise Palestine’ after war in Gaza,"**From The Telegraph:**

The United States could recognise a Palestinian state after the war in Gaza, according to reports suggesting the State Department is considering a shift in policy.

Antony Blinken, America’s top diplomat, has commissioned the State Department to review potential options for US and international recognition of a Palestinian state, Axios reported.

It comes after Lord Cameron revealed that Britain is weighing up whether to formally recognise Palestine as a state.

The Foreign Secretary said Britain had a “responsibility” to work towards a two-state solution, adding: “We with allies will look at the issue of recognising a Palestinian state, including at the United Nations.”

Matt Miller, a spokesman for the State Department, said the Biden administration has not shifted its policy on the issue, but declined to comment on reports of a review.

“We have been quite clear publicly that we support the establishment of an independent Palestinian state … with security guarantees for Israel,” he said. “That’s been the policy of the United States for some time.”

However, he continued: “We look at any number of options. That’s part of the normal planning process. The vast majority of options never usually get implemented.”

Washington has opposed recognition of a Palestinian state for decades, arguing that it should only be achieved through negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.

But a senior official told Axios that the administration’s push to find a diplomatic way out of Israel’s war in Gaza has required a re-examination of “old US paradigms and policies”.

The move towards normalising ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia is seen by the White House as a pathway to recognition of a Palestinian state, according to Axios.

She must break with Biden on Israel and Palestine,">[I resigned because of Joe Biden’s disastrous policy on Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza), providing the financial and diplomatic support for the Israeli military to massacre, starve and forcibly expel countless Palestinians in Gaza. As a staffer in the administration, I heard reports that Harris and her staff pushed the US president to adopt a policy on Gaza that was both more humane and in alignment with international law, but were rebuffed. I saw the Harris I moved to Iowa for in her speech in Selma, becoming the first senior administration official calling for a ceasefire, even as I was disappointed that it was only for six weeks. This was reportedly an effort by Biden’s team to water down her speech. It is shameful that Biden refused to listen to Harris – or the majority of Americans for that matter. Now that Biden has stepped aside, she has the opportunity to chart her own path on Israel and Palestine.

Harris must make clear that she supports using the US government’s leverage to end the bloodshed and reunite families. One clear way that she can do so is by supporting an arms embargo on offensive weapons for the Israeli military – a policy floated by Biden before he ultimately backtracked and greenlit Israel’s devastating ground invasion of Rafah.
>
>
>
>Once Israel’s brutal assault on Gaza ends, a President Harris could begin a new era in which the US government uses commonsense diplomatic and financial pressure to bring about a long-term political solution that would end Israel’s system of apartheid over Palestinians and guarantee equality, justice and safety for Palestinians and Israelis alike.
>
>
>
>By setting herself apart from Biden’s failed policy, Harris has the opportunity to rebuild a coalition to defeat Trump that would include progressives, young people and Arab Americans among others.
>
>
>
>More than 700,000 Democrats voted uncommitted during the primary in protest of Biden’s support for Israel’s war on Gaza. They are a crucial part of the coalition needed for Democrats to win swing states like Michigan, Georgia and Minnesota. The policies these voters are demanding are broadly popular among Democrats and Americans writ large. [Even a majority of my own community, American Jews, support conditioning arms shipments to Israel](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/article-804548).

>
>Harris must initiate a new era in American policy towards Israel, not just because it is the right thing to do, but because it is both the popular and the politically savvy popular thing to do. What better way to draw attention to the authoritarianism of Trump than for Harris to resoundly reject all authoritarianism abroad?
>
>
>
>Harris has at times fallen short of her promise to deliver justice. As a prosecutor, she put nonviolent drug users behind bars and she prosecuted parents for their children’s absence from school. She has also maintained close ties with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), the rightwing lobby primarily funded by Republican donors that has endorsed election-deniers and anti-abortion extremists. If Harris is serious about “putting justice on the ballot”, she must commit to ending mass incarceration and overzealous prosecution in this country and reject Aipac’s rightwing agenda as president. If she does both, she has the opportunity to turn out record numbers of voters to enable her to defeat Trump in November.

Perhaps all along it was rank and file voters who were smarter than Biden's inner circle. It was us who recognized Biden's old age and cognitive deficiencies made him unfit to serve into his mid-80's.

But over 9 million homes, schools, daycares, and businesses receive their water through a lead pipe, putting people at risk of lead exposure. Lead is a neurotoxin that can irreversibly harm brain development in children, and it can also accumulate in the bones and teeth, damage the kidneys, and interfere with the production of red blood cells needed to carry oxygen. Due to decades of inequitable infrastructure development and underinvestment, lead poisoning disproportionately affects low-income communities and communities of color. There is no safe level of exposure to lead. That is why the President made a **commitment to replace every lead pipe in the country within a decade** and coordinated a whole of government effort to deploy resources and leverage every tool across federal, state and local government to address lead hazards through the Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan. 

>As part of this unprecedented commitment, President Biden is traveling today to Wilmington, North Carolina, to announce **$3 billion through his Investing in America agenda to replace toxic lead pipes.** This investment, administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is part of the historic $15 billion in dedicated funding for lead pipe replacement provided by the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Today’s announcement delivers funding to every state and U.S. territory to help address lead in drinking water while creating good-paying jobs, many of them union jobs. In addition, this program funding is part of the President’s Justice40 Initiative, which set a goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities, and is helping address the inequities of lead exposure.

>Additionally, to further reduce lead exposure, **the Department of Housing and Urban Development is announcing today nearly $90 million** in available funding to reduce residential health hazards in public housing, including lead-based paint hazards, carbon monoxide, mold, radon, fire safety, and asbestos, advancing the President’s Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan.

>Today’s announcement from the EPA builds on more than $20 billion in water infrastructure investments that state and local governments have made through the President’s American Rescue Plan. North Carolina has invested close to $2 billion from the American Rescue Plan in more than 800 clean water, wastewater, and stormwater projects across the state and is using another $150 million to test for and remove lead hazards in every school and child care center across the state, a historic effort to remove lead from North Carolina schools.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), an independent who caucuses with Democrats, is forcing the politically tricky vote using a mechanism in U.S. foreign assistance law that requires the State Department to look into human rights practices of nations receiving U.S. aid.

The resolution would not alter U.S. aid to Israel, but it is still facing opposition from the Biden administration and many Democrats, who have raised concerns about the message the vote would send.

From one of the preeminent neocons, David Frum.  The fact that he is a Biden cheerleader is not the win Democrats think it is.  It shows the absolute degradation of the Democratic Party and how comically far Right the Overton Window is.

First, Israel struck Iran.  ""Israel should count score and strike back against Iran when the time is right"" is absolute nonsense.  Israel is the aggressor, and Iran has been the MORE reasonable party throughout all of this.  More reasonable than Israel OR Joe Biden.  Donald Trump tore up the Iran Deal because he hated everything Obama did.  What is Biden's excuse for not getting back into that deal 3 years later?  There isn't one.  Pure 1990's-era Zionist lunacy and pure stubbornness.

It is actively a terrible, terrible thing that we are helping fund our ""ally"" Israel as they starve and massacre innocent people as collective punishment for an attack that their general brutal treatment of Gazans had specifically propelled.  The fact that they ALSO want a world war--want to start one that US dollars and troops will have to fight--should immediately mean that we stop all funding to these rogue ungrateful f\*cking psychopaths, not that we leap into rebuilding their forces so that they can go and attack Iran again.  So that they can go and shoot sobbing people who are looking for their dead children's remains in the rubble in Gaza.

Frum has wanted a regional Middle East war for decades.  He has never ever cared about how many people will die, how close we could be to nuclear conflict, or how many trillions of dollars we throw into various holes in the world so we can protect corporate oil and defense interests.  Him championing the Great Work of Joe Biden for continuing to fund war crimes and catastrophic offensive provocations is almost literally sickening.  And, BTW, those war crimes will also likely cost Biden the slim chance he still has to be reelected.  So imagine a World War AND Trump, while you're smiling about how David Frum ""nailed Republicans"" for being obstructionist.

America does have an interest in the region, mainly to prevent the place blowing up in a huge war and, possibly, in a nuclear war.

Only idiots ignore that Israel has nuclear weapons, despite America's and Europe's best efforts to prevent Israel from developing those weapons. Israel does not admit it has those weapons but we all know it does.

**Many countries have vowed to destroy Israel**

But what most people don't know is that Israel has a doom's day policy that if it ever gets invaded or is nearing destruction, it will obliterate most of the Middle East in a nuclear firestorm. That policy is called the [Samson Option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Option).

America's interest in the region is simple; peace at all cost in order to create political stability necessary for commerce in the most oil rich area on Earth.

Also, America's interest in Israel is that it wants to prevent Israel from selling nuclear weapons technology to other countries that might eventually become hostile towards the US. 

Lastly, America wants to avoid a nuclear exchange where Israel would, in self-defense, destroy much of the Middle East.

Those are why America is supporting Israel, for stability, to prevent a proliferation of nuclear weapons through the world and to avoid a nuclear war.

**Why America sells weapons to Israel?**

Because if America doesn't, the French, the Chinese or the Russians will or Israel will make its own weapons, just like Israel copied the French Mirage to produce the [Kfir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAI_Kfir) or copied the F-16 to make the [Lavi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAI_Lavi). Israel also makes its own tanks, the [Merkava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkava) and its own missile systems.

**Why America supports Israel?**

Because having America threaten all the countries that would like to destroy Israel is the best way to avoid a nuclear conflict in the region, knowing that Israel's dooms day policy is to launch all of its nukes on the capital cities of its enemies.

**Basically that's the deal, either America ensures Israel's security or Israel gets invaded/destroyed and the whole Middle East becomes a radioactive wasteland.**

The actions of America are actually saving Arab lives.

**The worst thing that could happen to the Middle East is America deciding it no longer cares, remove its protection from Israel and allowing a war to start and possibly Israel launching nukes in desperation.**","  palestinian american believe, wrongly, that america has control over israel. nothing could be further from the truth.      america does have an interest in the region, mainly to prevent the place blowing up in a huge war and, possibly, in a nuclear war.    only idiots ignore that israel has nuclear weapons, despite america s and europe s best efforts to prevent israel from developing those weapons. israel does not admit it has those weapons but we all know it does.      many countries have vowed to destroy israel      but what most people don t know is that israel has a doom s day policy that if it ever gets invaded or is nearing destruction, it will obliterate most of the middle east in a nuclear firestorm. that policy is called the  samson option      america s interest in the region is simple  peace at all cost in order to create political stability necessary for commerce in the most oil rich area on earth.    also, america s interest in israel is that it wants to prevent israel from selling nuclear weapons technology to other countries that might eventually become hostile towards the us.     lastly, america wants to avoid a nuclear exchange where israel would, in self defense, destroy much of the middle east.    those are why america is supporting israel, for stability, to prevent a proliferation of nuclear weapons through the world and to avoid a nuclear war.      why america sells weapons to israel?      because if america doesn t, the french, the chinese or the russians will or israel will make its own weapons, just like israel copied the french mirage to produce the  kfir   or copied the f 16 to make the  lavi   israel also makes its own tanks, the  merkava   and its own missile systems.      why america supports israel?      because having america threaten all the countries that would like to destroy israel is the best way to avoid a nuclear conflict in the region, knowing that israel s dooms day policy is to launch all of its nukes on the capital cities of its enemies.      basically that s the deal, either america ensures israel s security or israel gets invaded destroyed and the whole middle east becomes a radioactive wasteland.      the actions of america are actually saving arab lives.      the worst thing that could happen to the middle east is america deciding it no longer cares, remove its protection from israel and allowing a war to start and possibly israel launching nukes in desperation.

lew1tl4,2024-07-25 16:04:57,politics,Palestine,1ebyk71,'Monstrous': Hear From An Israeli Hostage’s Relative Arrested During Netanyahu’s Speech To Congress,"> Mor, an Israeli citizen, said he sees the U.S. as the “greatest hope” for the release of his uncle. But as he watched Netanyahu on Wednesday deliver remarks to a joint session of Congress ― from his place in one of the galleries for guests, a seat he got via an invitation from Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) ― Mor couldn’t help himself. During one of the multiple standing ovations Netanyahu received, Mor stood up and yelled into the House of Representatives chamber three times: “1,400 deaths!”

> It was a reference to the initial Israeli estimate of deaths on Oct. 7., which has since been revised to around 1,200.

> “It was on [Netanyahu’s] watch,” Mor told HuffPost, that people like his cousin, Munder’s son, were slaughtered.

> “It’s mind-boggling” to see U.S. legislators applaud Netanyahu, he added, in his first interview since his arrest. “I know half of the people don’t believe a word he says, but still there’s this equation ― that we must fight ― that if you criticize Netanyahu, then you’re helping the antisemites.”

> “I think it’s bullshit: You have to oppose Netanyahu,” Mor continued. “It’s not that you’re an antisemite — you’re truthful.”

> Mor said he was approached by an usher after his third outburst, then arrested by police and brought a holding area, before being driven to a police station. He and five other relatives of Israeli hostages who also attended the speech have been charged under a statute in District of Columbia law that makes it illegal “knowingly, with force and violence, to enter or to remain upon the floor of either House of the Congress,” a spokesperson for the U.S. Capitol Police, Brianna Burch, told HuffPost.

> Mor said he was approached by an usher after his third outburst, then arrested by U.S. Capitol Police and brought to a holding area, before being driven to a police station. He and five other relatives of Israeli hostages ― who also attended the speech, and during it, unveiled protest T-shirts ― have been charged under a statute in District of Columbia law that makes it illegal “knowingly, with force and violence, to enter or to remain upon the floor of either House of the Congress,” a spokesperson for the U.S. Capitol Police, Brianna Burch, told HuffPost.

> The five others issued a joint statement earlier Wednesday evening, stating: “Some of us wore a T-shirt calling on our Prime Minister to finally seal that deal, because this is his responsibility. And for that perceived offense, we were removed from the visitors’ gallery. No matter what, we will continue to fight for those who cannot: our family members being held captive in Gaza.”

> On Tuesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) had threatened people who disrupted the Netanyahu speech with prosecution.

> Relatives of those taken hostage have for months criticized Netanyahu for continuing fighting in the Gaza Strip ― Hamas’ base ― rather than cutting a ceasefire deal to let the captives come home.

> In November, the U.S. helped orchestrate a brief truce and prisoner exchange between Hamas and Israel, freeing dozens of hostages, including Mor’s aunt, cousin and nephew. Mor believes President Joe Biden’s help was “instrumental” in their release. Netanyahu’s government argues it is still prioritizing the freedom of the hostages, including through military raids to free specific groups of them.

> Mor isn’t sure what to do now, he said: He’s been given a court date for Aug. 14 but he is scheduled to head back to Israel on Aug. 2.

> He said it was “ludicrous” that he was arrested during the speech and wants to shift the focus back to Netanyahu. The prime minister brought the families of several hostages to Washington with him, a choice Mor described as “monstrous.”

> “Only an extremely cynical person could even think about doing such a thing,” Mor told HuffPost.

> Omar issued a statement on Mor’s arrest Wednesday night, saying: “He could not stand to listen to his harmful rhetoric. As a family member of an Israeli hostage, he has experienced the agonizing pain of Netanyahu’s failure to bring the hostages home and inability to make a deal. His bravery to call out Netanyahu’s genocide mirrors the sentiment shared by millions of Americans who want to see a permanent ceasefire and an end to this genocide funded by our tax dollars.”

> For now, Mor is determined to keep the focus on Netanyahu and to undercut the prime minister’s attempt to project the impression that he’s respected abroad, especially by the U.S., Israel’s closest ally.

> “He’s not answering the people he’s responsible for. He sees himself as an American statesman and we can see the result: It’s a complete betrayal of his own citizens,” Mor argued.","  mor, an israeli citizen, said he sees the u.s. as the  greatest hope  for the release of his uncle. but as he watched netanyahu on wednesday deliver remarks to a joint session of congress   from his place in one of the galleries for guests, a seat he got via an invitation from rep. ilhan omar  d minn.    mor couldn t help himself. during one of the multiple standing ovations netanyahu received, mor stood up and yelled into the house of representatives chamber three times   1,400 deaths!

It was interesting to read about the perspectives of some of these creators regarding their experiences and their content from this year's DNC.

loii9oa,2024-09-23 12:14:47,politics,Palestine,1fniw9o,Has Michael Regan’s EPA Kept Its Promises?,"EPA Administrator Michael Regan became the face of the Biden administration’s commitment to environmental racial justice—and the target of politicians who seek to hobble the agency, Vann R. Newkirk II reports. [https://theatln.tc/sKSE4YKc](https://theatln.tc/sKSE4YKc)

Regan, the EPA’s second Black administrator, focused his agency on addressing environmental racism. Black, Indigenous, Latino, and low-income communities are far more likely to experience environmental problems than people in high-income, majority-white areas. Black people, for instance, suffer 54 percent more pollution from industrial facilities than other Americans, contributing to child-asthma rates that are about twice as high as those of white children. Before the Biden administration, the EPA had been a clear failure in its capacity as a civil-rights watchdog; a 2015 analysis found that the EPA’s Office of Civil Rights had not made a single formal finding of discrimination—ever.

Discrimination can be hard to establish if one must prove intent. To combat this, the EPA’s investigations relied on “disparate-impact theory,” which accounts for the racial impact of specific policy decisions, regardless of whether outright racial bigotry is evident. Disparate-impact theory has been a powerful tool for enforcing civil-rights law, but it’s also controversial.

Among GOP lawmakers, the EPA’s investigations “helped earn the agency a reputation for being ‘woke.’ And, undoubtedly, it was easier to pin that reputation on a Black man,” Newkirk writes. Many Republican attorneys general have found in the EPA and Regan a handy foil for advancing a broader agenda, and hope to use the courts to end all federal civil-rights enforcement based on disparate impact.

Eventually figuring that any case involving disparate impact would be challenged in court—and that an adverse ruling could jeopardize the future of the idea for the whole government—the EPA backed away from some of its investigations. Regan can claim concrete improvements for disadvantaged communities during his tenure. But, Newkirk continues, the EPA will likely finish Joe Biden’s term with a civil-rights-adjudication record “little better than the ones under his predecessors.”

MAGA Inc., the Donald Trump-aligned Super PAC, joined TikTok on Wednesday, marking the first group affiliated with Trump to do so.

The independent super PAC kicked off its TikTok page with several videos, including one that slammed Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s record of supporting Democrats and going after Republicans, describing him as “a radical leftist.” Another video talked about Trump’s tax cuts and asked viewers whether they could “afford four more years of Joe Biden.” The latest social media account will be used to spread campaign messages, rapid response, and other pro-Trump content.

“There’s millions of voters on TikTok, and @MAGA will deliver President Donald J. Trump’s pro-freedom, pro-America agenda every day with the facts and stories that matter,” Taylor Budowich, CEO of MAGA Inc., said in a statement. “We aren’t trying to set policy, we are trying to win an election.”

Budowich also offered up some insight as to why the organization decided to join TikTok, despite Republican condemnations of the platform’s ties to China: He said they wouldn’t “cede any platform to Joe Biden and the Democrats,” (the Biden campaign launched its own TikTok account in February) and promised that Trump’s “America First agenda will be brought to every corner of the internet.” Fox News first reported the news.

Why? Because the Chemical Facilities Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) are managed by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within DHS. Rand Paul thinks CISA is in cahoots with big tech to censor conservatives online. So he's preventing the agency from overseeing security at facilities that could be threatened by terrorism (either by attacks or theft of highly hazardous materials) because he thinks Facebook and Google are censoring conservative disinformation.","good opinion piece but fails in one key aspect      yet despite broad bipartisan support in congress and from chemical companies, first responders, and others, the program remains unauthorized. the reauthorization bill overwhelmingly passed the u.s. house of representatives in july, 409 to 1, but the bill remains stalled in the senate.    one person   rand paul   is blocking the bill from even coming up for discussion in the senate.     why? because the chemical facilities anti terrorism standards  cfats  are managed by the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency  cisa  within dhs. rand paul thinks cisa is in cahoots with big tech to censor conservatives online. so he s preventing the agency from overseeing security at facilities that could be threatened by terrorism  either by attacks or theft of highly hazardous materials  because he thinks facebook and google are censoring conservative disinformation.","good opinion piece fails one key aspect yet despite broad bipartisan support congress chemical companies, first responders, others, program remains unauthorized. reauthorization bill overwhelmingly passed u.s. house representatives july, 409 1, bill remains stalled senate. one person rand paul blocking bill even coming discussion senate. why? chemical facilities anti terrorism standards cfats managed cybersecurity infrastructure security agency cisa within dhs. rand paul thinks cisa cahoots big tech censor conservatives online. preventing agency overseeing security facilities could threatened terrorism either attacks theft highly hazardous materials thinks facebook google censoring conservative disinformation.",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1b8ywr8/the_us_has_lost_a_critical_tool_for_handling/,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1b8ywr8/the_us_has_lost_a_critical_tool_for_handling/ktsbbtz,46.26984126984127,-0.0647482014388489,1,1,0

In 2015, during the Presidential campaign the Republican congress had Netanyahu address them without notifying the Obama administration, where Netayahu assailed the administration for its support of the nuclear deal with Iran. This was in direct support of Trumps position and was later rewarded by Trump going along with the relocation of Israel's capitol to Jerusalem.  No interference there,  right?

The fact is that Schumer specifically called for Israeli action after the current conflict in Gaza has wound down. We have freedom of speech here, as the poor persecuted Republicans always whine about being suppressed. Schumer has the right to express a loss of confidence in Netanyahu.

There was no mention of support for any other Israeli replacement, it was all about how Bibi is leading Israel down the road to perdition.","mcconnell   it is grotesque and hypocritical for americans who hyperventilate about interference in our own democracy to call for the israeli leader s removal.     in 2015, during the presidential campaign the republican congress had netanyahu address them without notifying the obama administration, where netayahu assailed the administration for its support of the nuclear deal with iran. this was in direct support of trumps position and was later rewarded by trump going along with the relocation of israel s capitol to jerusalem.  no interference there,  right?    the fact is that schumer specifically called for israeli action after the current conflict in gaza has wound down. we have freedom of speech here, as the poor persecuted republicans always whine about being suppressed. schumer has the right to express a loss of confidence in netanyahu.    there was no mention of support for any other israeli replacement, it was all about how bibi is leading israel down the road to perdition.","mcconnell grotesque hypocritical americans hyperventilate interference democracy call israeli leader removal. 2015, presidential campaign republican congress netanyahu address without notifying obama administration, netayahu assailed administration support nuclear deal iran. direct support trumps position later rewarded trump going along relocation israel capitol jerusalem. interference there, right? fact schumer specifically called israeli action current conflict gaza wound down. freedom speech here, poor persecuted republicans always whine suppressed. schumer right express loss confidence netanyahu. mention support israeli replacement, bibi leading israel road perdition.",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1bk6dys/senator_mcconnell_pushes_back_against_leader/,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1bk6dys/senator_mcconnell_pushes_back_against_leader/kvvynce,50.83519108280255,0.0063694267515923,0,1,0
