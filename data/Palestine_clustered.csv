I spoke about this occurrence with a family member today. A video of the infero was on TV and I said, ""that's truly hell"" and my uncle said, ""yeah it really is"". I then said, ""Israel is really going to make the Middle East a war zone again"" to which he responded, ""but the Houthis sent a drone attack first"". I asked sarcastically, ""well, why could that have possibly happened?"" He said, ""because the Houthis are an Islamist fundamentalist group and they're terrorists"". I responded, ""or maybe because Israel has had Palestinian under siege for the past 80 years and Palestine has had practically no defense in that time frame until now"". He then left the conversation.

People are so quick to label muslim groups fighting for their countries or interests as terrorists, yet when IOF kills 140k people in Palestine, thats not terrorism. That's counter terrorism. When Yemen helps their suffering ally, that's terrorism. When Israel creates a literal inferno in Yemen, that's counter terrorism.

I remember a quote from somewhere if someone could guide me il edit and acclaim it about ‘look for someone you cannot criticise and that is your enemy’.

Time and time again we find our government officials proposing we are the lands of democracy while our representatives are financed in a way they cannot lose with abundant media support and some parties that dare step away from the will of the west are sabotaged and sunk (you know of what I speak). 

I believe and I wish that this injustice to the Palestinian people will wake the western populous up to the hypocrisy of our leaders due to whoever fills their wallets they represent and not the constituents of who they owe their seat of power to.

Not fun fact: US Leahy Laws are supposed to limit weapons sales to foreign entities that commit human rights violations. Within the US Leahy Laws, only Israel has a special mention of our trust in their judicial process, that allows Israel to investigate themselves and report to us to determine their own eligibility for further US weapons sales. No other foreign nation gets that parameter. 

It's discussed in further detail in a Guardian article titled [‘Different rules’: special policies keep US supplying weapons to Israel despite alleged abuses

](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/18/us-supply-weapons-israel-alleged-abuses-human-rights)

Excerpt:
The two-page 2021 agreement, which has received little media attention, formalized changes in the Leahy law and included a statement about how Israel has a “robust, independent and effective legal system, including its military justice system”. The US signed more than two dozen similar agreements with other countries at that time – including Greece, Jordan, Georgia, Ukraine and Latvia – but none contain language endorsing the other countries’ military justice systems. ...

Tim Rieser, a longtime senior adviser to Leahy, who helped write the Leahy law in the 1990s, said the inclusion of the language was probably intended to help Israel avoid scrutiny under the Leahy law, because it suggests as a matter of fact that Israel’s military justice system is independent enough to address any alleged human rights violations.

“The language added to the US-Israel agreement, without any consultation with Congress, is factually inaccurate and wrongly suggests that the [Leahy] Law doesn’t need to be applied,” Rieser said.","us officials let us let israel investigate their own war crimes, as always, and tell us they are innocent. or that they made a little mistake, and they will try better next time. not fun fact us leahy laws are supposed to limit weapons sales to foreign entities that commit human rights violations. within the us leahy laws, only israel has a special mention of our trust in their judicial process, that allows israel to investigate themselves and report to us to determine their own eligibility for further us weapons sales. no other foreign nation gets that parameter. it is discussed in further detail in a guardian article titled different rules special policies keep us supplying weapons to israel despite alleged abuses excerpt the two page 2021 agreement, which has received little media attention, formalized changes in the leahy law and included a statement about how israel has a robust, independent and effective legal system, including its military justice system . the us signed more than two dozen similar agreements with other countries at that time including greece, jordan, georgia, ukraine and latvia but none contain language endorsing the other countries military justice systems. ... tim rieser, a longtime senior adviser to leahy, who helped write the leahy law in the 1990s, said the inclusion of the language was probably intended to help israel avoid scrutiny under the leahy law, because it suggests as a matter of fact that israel s military justice system is independent enough to address any alleged human rights violations. the language added to the us israel agreement, without any consultation with congress, is factually inaccurate and wrongly suggests that the leahy law does not need to be applied, rieser said.","us officials let us let israel investigate war crimes, always, tell us innocent. made little mistake, try better next time. fun fact us leahy laws supposed limit weapons sales foreign entities commit human rights violations. within us leahy laws, israel special mention trust judicial process, allows israel investigate report us determine eligibility us weapons sales. foreign nation gets parameter. discussed detail guardian article titled different rules special policies keep us supplying weapons israel despite alleged abuses excerpt two page 2021 agreement, received little media attention, formalized changes leahy law included statement israel robust, independent effective legal system, including military justice system . us signed two dozen similar agreements countries time including greece, jordan, georgia, ukraine latvia none contain language endorsing countries military justice systems. ... tim rieser, longtime senior adviser leahy, helped write leahy law 1990s, said inclusion language probably intended help israel avoid scrutiny leahy law, suggests matter fact israel military justice system independent enough address alleged human rights violations. language added us israel agreement, without consultation congress, factually inaccurate wrongly suggests leahy law need applied, rieser said.",61,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1d2u4ek/how_many_more_charred_corpses_does_the_president/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1d2u4ek/how_many_more_charred_corpses_does_the_president/l62wbnt,52.91195524146054,0.9546,4.110873864173311,8,-1,-1,5

These pagers, also used by doctors and workers, were detonated among civilians going about their daily lives in Lebanon. They injured dozens of innocent civilians, including a 10-year-old boy who was killed. Many other children and civilians were injured in this terrorist attack while driving, shopping, or picking up their children from school. The pagers of all doctors and nurses were targeted. With one exception, the American University Hospital in Beirut, which asked staff to replace their pagers ten days ago. We Americans are fools to think that what happens abroad could never happen here. Just think that suddenly your phone, your security system, your children’s tablets are time bombs that explode according to the “whims” of a country. Setting off so many pagers at the same time when you don’t know if all those people are away from the crowd is not murder, it’s terrorism. State terrorism, plain and simple! This was one of the worst terrorist attacks in modern history & the demons responsible for this indiscriminate attack are protected from prosecution by the US. WE MUST PROTEST!

The Borkum, a cargo ship accused by Spain’s leftist parties Sumar and Podemos of carrying weapons to Israel, refused to stop at the southeastern Spanish port of Cartagena. The decision was communicated at midnight by the shipowner to the Maritime Captaincy and confirmed by sources from Spain’s Ministry of Transportation, who insist that the final destination of the cargo is the Czech Republic, not Israel.

These sources did not rule out that the claim against the Borkum originated in a confusion, as another cargo ship with a confirmed destination of Haifa, Israel, had been previously denied access to Spanish ports.

The shipowner — a German company, although the vessel is flying the flag of Barbuda and Antigua — communicated that the ship would not make the stopover, even though all documentation was in order and it would have had no issues accessing Cartagena port.

On Thursday, the Borkum remained anchored off Cape Tiñoso near Cartagena, where it was scheduled to dock on Friday morning. A protest had been planned at the port. The ship ultimately canceled its stopover in Spain and headed for Slovenia instead

Sumar’s Íñigo Errejón and Podemos’ Irene Montero congratulated each other on social media, claiming the decision proved them right about the Borkum carrying weapons to Israel.

lsntim4,2024-10-19 09:29:27,Palestine,Israel,1g7364b,Is Israel's Plan to Wipe Out Palestinians? Has the World Normalized the Palestinian Genocide?,"Yes, they want to kill as many as possible.

Why? The UK and later the USA continued their colonial policies of the Middle-East after WW2. This strategy of theirs is to install a zealot, fundamentalist elite minority to rule over the majority.

However, after the Suez-crisis, I believe the UK and USA started more unconditionally to support Israel, because of the control over the region Israel provides. Because Israel is completely dependent on American protection for it's survival. However, the unconditional support has made the zionists more radical without any pushback.

Now the zionists have free game, after 60 years of internal radicalization to kill, to murder as many as they want. With the stranglehold the USA has on the UN, nothing really can stop them, and the USA (read  leadership) doesn't really care what happens, as long as they keep control over the Middle-East via Israel.

So no, Israel does not control the USA (which alludes to a real antisemtic trope) the USA controls Israel. USA leadership weaponizes groups like AIPAC to surpress critical voices towards Israel.

Due to UN stranglehold of the Americans, the countries that support Palestine are diplomatically being restrained, and are to wary or weak to militarily intervene.

Then, the other powerblock, the EU, is through NATO vassals to the USA. Due to the war on terror, 9/11, Arab Spring and refugee waves, as well as economic regression due to unfair EU laws on housing and trade, the far right is on the rise in the EU. Due to 20+ years of demonization of muslims, it is fairly easy to paint an anti-Palestine narrative.

kb9qmb4,2023-11-29 15:21:07,Palestine,Israel,186l28k,Why is Reddit so pro Israel?,"Pro Israel people are also very vocal. The subreddit for the city I live in often has pro Israel people who want to start getting into fights and make posts to incite fighting. 

At times the pro Israel stuff feels like they are living in a different reality, where they seem to genuinely believe that being opposed to slaughtering as many Palestinians as possible is antisemitic and that it is the only way to avoid another genocide of jews. 

I grew up as a Zionist. Part of my family is Jewish and many of my mentors in academia were Jewish Zionists. I accepted my mentors truths as my truths. Only when I was exposed to realities about the occupation 8 or so years ago did I start doing my own investigation and became a supporter of Palestine. 

I felt very betrayed. I truly believed that Palestine was empty and not valuable land like neighbouring oil rich counties, that Palestinians refused to accept reasonable peace agreements and that all conflicts were started by Palestinians and that the big issue was terrorism perpetrated by Palestinians. I was told that you “can’t reason with suicide bombers because they don’t value life” without being curious as to what conditions/treatment would cause someone to feel that this was their only option to resist. 

I know better now, but many people have been indoctrinated with these same lies.

I would highly recommend watching the documentary Israelism. It’s about how Jewish youth are indoctrinated to be pro Israel from birth through college and also features how some Jewish antizionists went from being zionists to anti Zionist peace activists.","pro israel people are also very vocal. the subreddit for the city i live in often has pro israel people who want to start getting into fights and make posts to incite fighting. at times the pro israel stuff feels like they are living in a different reality, where they seem to genuinely believe that being opposed to slaughtering as many palestinians as possible is antisemitic and that it is the only way to avoid another genocide of jews. i grew up as a zionist. part of my family is jewish and many of my mentors in academia were jewish zionists. i accepted my mentors truths as my truths. only when i was exposed to realities about the occupation 8 or so years ago did i start doing my own investigation and became a supporter of palestine. i felt very betrayed. i truly believed that palestine was empty and not valuable land like neighbouring oil rich counties, that palestinians refused to accept reasonable peace agreements and that all conflicts were started by palestinians and that the big issue was terrorism perpetrated by palestinians. i was told that you cannot reason with suicide bombers because they do not value life without being curious as to what conditions treatment would cause someone to feel that this was their only option to resist. i know better now, but many people have been indoctrinated with these same lies. i would highly recommend watching the documentary israelism. it is about how jewish youth are indoctrinated to be pro israel from birth through college and also features how some jewish antizionists went from being zionists to anti zionist peace activists.","pro israel people also vocal. subreddit city live often pro israel people want start getting fights make posts incite fighting. times pro israel stuff feels like living different reality, seem genuinely believe opposed slaughtering many palestinians possible antisemitic way avoid another genocide jews. grew zionist. part family jewish many mentors academia jewish zionists. accepted mentors truths truths. exposed realities occupation 8 years ago start investigation became supporter palestine. felt betrayed. truly believed palestine empty valuable land like neighbouring oil rich counties, palestinians refused accept reasonable peace agreements conflicts started palestinians big issue terrorism perpetrated palestinians. told cannot reason suicide bombers value life without curious conditions treatment would cause someone feel option resist. know better now, many people indoctrinated lies. would highly recommend watching documentary israelism. jewish youth indoctrinated pro israel birth college also features jewish antizionists went zionists anti zionist peace activists.",70,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/186l28k/why_is_reddit_so_pro_israel/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/186l28k/why_is_reddit_so_pro_israel/kb9qmb4,44.06962380685009,0.7086,4.248495242049359,8,-1,-1,5

The Delusion of Invincibility: Why Israel Will Lose to Palestinian Resistance

History’s lesson is clear: no occupying force can crush the will of an oppressed people. Israel’s belief in its military might and strategic dominance over the Palestinians is not just flawed — it’s doomed. Here’s why Israel will ultimately lose this war.

The Indomitable Human Spirit

Palestinians fight for their very existence. Decades of brutal occupation have only hardened their resolve. From the Vietnamese against the Americans to the Algerians against the French, history proves that the oppressed will always resist. The Palestinian resistance, born from relentless injustice, cannot be snuffed out by bombs and bullets.

Israel’s heavy reliance on its advanced military arsenal is a misguided strategy. Every airstrike, every ground invasion only fans the flames of Palestinian defiance. Occupying forces have always failed to secure lasting victory through sheer force — Israel is no exception.

Global Sympathy Is Shifting

Every demolished home in the West Bank and every missile strike on Gaza erodes Israel’s standing in the world. The images of Palestinian suffering are rallying global condemnation and support for their cause. Israel’s actions are isolating it diplomatically and strengthening the Palestinian fight.

Occupation is inherently unsustainable. Israel’s policies of land theft, settlement expansion, and the blockade of Gaza fuel the resistance. Suppression only begets defiance. The more Israel tightens its grip, the more the Palestinian spirit of resistance grows.

The Illusion of Security

Israel’s oppressive measures in the name of security create more enemies and insecurity. True security can never be achieved through brutality and injustice. As long as Israel continues its occupation, it will face an unending cycle of violence and retaliation.

The occupation is corroding Israeli society from within. A nation raised on perpetual conflict and moral ambiguity cannot sustain itself. Growing internal dissent against occupation policies signals a weakening resolve.

Israel is rotting from the inside.","the delusion of invincibility why israel will lose to palestinian resistance history s lesson is clear no occupying force can crush the will of an oppressed people. israel s belief in its military might and strategic dominance over the palestinians is not just flawed it is doomed. here is why israel will ultimately lose this war. the indomitable human spirit palestinians fight for their very existence. decades of brutal occupation have only hardened their resolve. from the vietnamese against the americans to the algerians against the french, history proves that the oppressed will always resist. the palestinian resistance, born from relentless injustice, cannot be snuffed out by bombs and bullets. israel s heavy reliance on its advanced military arsenal is a misguided strategy. every airstrike, every ground invasion only fans the flames of palestinian defiance. occupying forces have always failed to secure lasting victory through sheer force israel is no exception. global sympathy is shifting every demolished home in the west bank and every missile strike on gaza erodes israel s standing in the world. the images of palestinian suffering are rallying global condemnation and support for their because. israel s actions are isolating it diplomatically and strengthening the palestinian fight. occupation is inherently unsustainable. israel s policies of land theft, settlement expansion, and the blockade of gaza fuel the resistance. suppression only begets defiance. the more israel tightens its grip, the more the palestinian spirit of resistance grows. the illusion of security israel s oppressive measures in the name of security create more enemies and insecurity. true security can never be achieved through brutality and injustice. as long as israel continues its occupation, it will face an unending cycle of violence and retaliation. the occupation is corroding israeli society from within. a nation raised on perpetual conflict and moral ambiguity cannot sustain itself. growing internal dissent against occupation policies signals a weakening resolve. israel is rotting from the inside.","delusion invincibility israel lose palestinian resistance history lesson clear occupying force crush oppressed people. israel belief military might strategic dominance palestinians flawed doomed. israel ultimately lose war. indomitable human spirit palestinians fight existence. decades brutal occupation hardened resolve. vietnamese americans algerians french, history proves oppressed always resist. palestinian resistance, born relentless injustice, cannot snuffed bombs bullets. israel heavy reliance advanced military arsenal misguided strategy. every airstrike, every ground invasion fans flames palestinian defiance. occupying forces always failed secure lasting victory sheer force israel exception. global sympathy shifting every demolished home west bank every missile strike gaza erodes israel standing world. images palestinian suffering rallying global condemnation support because. israel actions isolating diplomatically strengthening palestinian fight. occupation inherently unsustainable. israel policies land theft, settlement expansion, blockade gaza fuel resistance. suppression begets defiance. israel tightens grip, palestinian spirit resistance grows. illusion security israel oppressive measures name security create enemies insecurity. true security never achieved brutality injustice. long israel continues occupation, face unending cycle violence retaliation. occupation corroding israeli society within. nation raised perpetual conflict moral ambiguity cannot sustain itself. growing internal dissent occupation policies signals weakening resolve. israel rotting inside.",224,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1e51bx7/how_israel_is_losing_the_war_not_just_in_public/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1e51bx7/how_israel_is_losing_the_war_not_just_in_public/ldipejx,48.020833333333336,-0.9908,5.41164605185504,0,-1,-1,4

Israelis should legit be studied because their country feels almost like a laboratory of sorts researching how bloodthirsty can a nation truly be.

ka6vrnp,2023-11-21 18:24:50,Palestine,Israel,180hn7y,Is public opinion on Israel changing ?,"Speaking for America, where I live - yes 100%. There has been a shift happening over the past few years that is accelerating due to the current genocide. 

The shift exists in 2 dimensions. The first dimension is between conservatives and liberals. After the BLM movement a few years ago, many Americans started seeing the plight of Palestinians through the lens of oppressed groups in the US. Still, some “liberals” are showing their true colors right now by still supporting the genocide. They are truly pro war people that pretend to be liberals. 

The second dimension is between young and old. Young people, as evidenced especially by recent polling (look up recent Gallup and nbc polls) are much more sympathetic to Palestine. This is due to several reasons. For one, older generation in the US recall an israel that was portrayed to them as a young, white looking nation fighting for survival against all odds after its people emerged from the tragedy of holocaust. The younger generation sees Israel as the aggressor. The second major shift is that younger people don’t depend on main stream news sources like cnn and Fox News which are notoriously pro Israel in the US. They are looking more at direct accounts thanks to social media and the general disintermediation of news.","speaking for america, where i live yes 100 . there has been a shift happening over the past few years that is accelerating due to the current genocide. the shift exists in 2 dimensions. the first dimension is between conservatives and liberals. after the blm movement a few years ago, many americans started seeing the plight of palestinians through the lens of oppressed groups in the us. still, some liberals are showing their true colors right now by still supporting the genocide. they are truly pro war people that pretend to be liberals. the second dimension is between young and old. young people, as evidenced especially by recent polling look up recent gallup and nbc polls are much more sympathetic to palestine. this is due to several reasons. for one, older generation in the us recall an israel that was portrayed to them as a young, white looking nation fighting for survival against all odds after its people emerged from the tragedy of holocaust. the younger generation sees israel as the aggressor. the second major shift is that younger people do not depend on main stream news sources like cnn and fox news which are notoriously pro israel in the us. they are looking more at direct accounts thanks to social media and the general disintermediation of news.","speaking america, live yes 100 . shift happening past years accelerating due current genocide. shift exists 2 dimensions. first dimension conservatives liberals. blm movement years ago, many americans started seeing plight palestinians lens oppressed groups us. still, liberals showing true colors right still supporting genocide. truly pro war people pretend liberals. second dimension young old. young people, evidenced especially recent polling look recent gallup nbc polls much sympathetic palestine. due several reasons. one, older generation us recall israel portrayed young, white looking nation fighting survival odds people emerged tragedy holocaust. younger generation sees israel aggressor. second major shift younger people depend main stream news sources like cnn fox news notoriously pro israel us. looking direct accounts thanks social media general disintermediation news.",102,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/180hn7y/is_public_opinion_on_israel_changing/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/180hn7y/is_public_opinion_on_israel_changing/ka6vrnp,39.00230414746544,0.4927,4.624972813284271,8,-1,-1,5

>Administrative detention is  the incarceration of people who have not been convicted of – or even charged with –  a crime. Israel uses this extreme power continuously and extensively, detaining hundreds of Palestinians on a regular basis. According to figures published by the Israel Prison Service, in March 2023, Israel was holding 1,017 people in administrative detention, all but 15 of them Palestinians. Ten of the detainees are minors between the ages of 16 and 18. This is the highest number of administrative detainees since April 2003, when Israel held 1,140 administrative detainees.

They’re mean. They. Are. All. Mean. Like to their core. I remember one girl shared in Chapel (our first class) how her mother spit and slammed the door on two Jehovah Witnesses and the little girl they had with them and everyone clapped. 

I stood up and asked what was wrong with them? How is this love? We sang that song all the time “And they’ll know we are Christians by our love”. I told them they were all ugly and full of hate. I was prayed over then kicked out. My childhood sucked, but I think that day was one of my happiest. Valley Christian School. Worst people ever. All white. That’s what they are, supremacists wrapped in a religion worshiping a God they made in their image. 

They’re the purity cult assholes too. Two women from that school ended up in years of therapy. One was so ashamed she got a condition called Vaginismus. Had to have surgery. Luckily the guy she married was wonderful and left the church with her. The other had been systemically raped by her father.

lptqe18,2024-10-01 15:30:52,Palestine,Israel,1ftl6f3,Israel advertising real estate sales for colonizers in southern Lebanon,"Plans to establish illegal settlements in southern Lebanon aren’t surprising. The Israeli government can then claim that any attacks on those illegal settlements constitute “terrorism”, with the U.S. providing arms for Israel to commit retaliatory war crimes, saying “Israel has a right to defend itself”.  Israel can then steal a wider swath of southern Lebanon, claiming that a bigger buffer zone is needed for its safety. 

These plans are also in keeping with settler plans for Gaza.

In order to successfully accomplish a laser guided strike it is necessary for a platform, such as a drone, to “illuminate” the target with a laser while the missile is launched. In order to achieve accurate targeting, platforms which take part in this kind of targeting, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or fast jets, are equipped with advanced optics and sensor pods. These are capable of extremely high optical magnification.

This is notable because at least one of the vehicles clearly bears the logo of World Central Kitchen on the roof.  It is likely these markings would have been visible from above when the strike was carried out, although this depends on the capability of the optic used to track the vehicle.

The Jewish Council of Australia reject the State of Israel as inherently connected to Jews and support the rights of Palestinians. There are some similar groups like the Jewish Voice for Peace. But too be honest these groups are small.

The Australian Jewish Association is the opposite, an outright far-right genocidal organisation. They gets some play with sections of the non-Jewish right wing in Australia, seeing eye-to-eye on Islamophobia basically.

Most Jewish groups in Australia are somewhere between the two above and general sit under the Executive Council of Australian Jewry. They invariably support Zionism but usually more passively or at least less openly bloodthirsty compared to the AJA.

On **February 25, 2024**, the world witnessed a harrowing act of protest outside the **Embassy of Israel in Washington, D.C.** United States military serviceman **Aaron Bushnell** set himself on fire, engulfed in flames, as a desperate plea against the ongoing **Israel–Hamas war**. [His last words echoed through the smoke and pain: “I will no longer be complicit in genocide.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-immolation_of_Aaron_Bushnell)

# The Tragic Act

Bushnell’s self-immolation was broadcast live on **Twitch**, capturing the raw intensity of his anguish. [As the flames consumed him, he repeatedly screamed, “Free Palestine.” His sacrifice marked a grim milestone: the first time an active-duty member of the United States military had immolated themselves in protest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-immolation_of_Aaron_Bushnell)

# The Motivation

Bushnell’s message was clear: he could no longer bear the weight of complicity. His planned act of protest was a response to the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [In a message sent to media outlets before the incident, he wrote, “Today, I am planning to engage in an extreme act of protest against the genocide of the Palestinian people.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-immolation_of_Aaron_Bushnell)

# Apartheid and Discrimination

To understand the context behind Bushnell’s desperate act, we must delve into the deeply entrenched issues plaguing the region. The **occupied Palestinian territory** has become a crucible of discrimination, where a dual legal and political system privileges Israeli Jewish settlers while leaving millions of Palestinians without rights. Here are some stark realities:

1. **Legal Disparities**: Within the same geographic space, Israeli settlers enjoy privileges, while more than three million Palestinians face institutional discrimination. [Walls, checkpoints, and roads separate these communities, perpetuating inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-immolation_of_Aaron_Bushnell)
2. **Gaza’s Desperation**: Another two million Palestinians reside in Gaza, often described as an “open-air prison.” They lack adequate access to basic necessities like power, water, and healthcare. [Their economy is collapsing, and their freedom of movement is severely restricted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-immolation_of_Aaron_Bushnell)
3. **Apartheid Allegations**: International human rights experts, including the UN Special Rapporteur, have labeled Israel’s policies as apartheid. The discriminatory regime prioritizes Jewish Israelis over Palestinians based on racial-national-ethnic identity.","on february 25, 2024 , the world witnessed a harrowing act of protest outside the embassy of israel in washington, d.c. united states military serviceman aaron bushnell set himself on fire, engulfed in flames, as a desperate plea against the ongoing israel hamas war . his last words echoed through the smoke and pain i will no longer be complicit in genocide. the tragic act bushnell s self immolation was broadcast live on twitch , capturing the raw intensity of his anguish. as the flames consumed him, he repeatedly screamed, free palestine. his sacrifice marked a grim milestone the first time an active duty member of the united states military had immolated themselves in protest the motivation bushnell s message was clear he could no longer bear the weight of complicity. his planned act of protest was a response to the ongoing israeli palestinian conflict. in a message sent to media outlets before the incident, he wrote, today, i am planning to engage in an extreme act of protest against the genocide of the palestinian people. apartheid and discrimination to understand the context behind bushnell s desperate act, we must delve into the deeply entrenched issues plaguing the region. the occupied palestinian territory has become a crucible of discrimination, where a dual legal and political system privileges israeli jewish settlers while leaving millions of palestinians without rights. here are some stark realities 1. legal disparities within the same geographic space, israeli settlers enjoy privileges, while more than three million palestinians face institutional discrimination. walls, checkpoints, and roads separate these communities, perpetuating inequality 2. gaza s desperation another two million palestinians reside in gaza, often described as an open air prison. they lack adequate access to basic necessities like power, water, and healthcare. their economy is collapsing, and their freedom of movement is severely restricted 3. apartheid allegations international human rights experts, including the un special rapporteur, have labeled israel s policies as apartheid. the discriminatory regime prioritizes jewish israelis over palestinians based on racial national ethnic identity.","february 25, 2024 , world witnessed harrowing act protest outside embassy israel washington, d.c. united states military serviceman aaron bushnell set fire, engulfed flames, desperate plea ongoing israel hamas war . last words echoed smoke pain longer complicit genocide. tragic act bushnell self immolation broadcast live twitch , capturing raw intensity anguish. flames consumed him, repeatedly screamed, free palestine. sacrifice marked grim milestone first time active duty member united states military immolated protest motivation bushnell message clear could longer bear weight complicity. planned act protest response ongoing israeli palestinian conflict. message sent media outlets incident, wrote, today, planning engage extreme act protest genocide palestinian people. apartheid discrimination understand context behind bushnell desperate act, must delve deeply entrenched issues plaguing region. occupied palestinian territory become crucible discrimination, dual legal political system privileges israeli jewish settlers leaving millions palestinians without rights. stark realities 1. legal disparities within geographic space, israeli settlers enjoy privileges, three million palestinians face institutional discrimination. walls, checkpoints, roads separate communities, perpetuating inequality 2. gaza desperation another two million palestinians reside gaza, often described open air prison. lack adequate access basic necessities like power, water, healthcare. economy collapsing, freedom movement severely restricted 3. apartheid allegations international human rights experts, including un special rapporteur, labeled israel policies apartheid. discriminatory regime prioritizes jewish israelis palestinians based racial national ethnic identity.",453,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1b0i5ig/us_airmen_aaron_bushnell_has_died_after_setting/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1b0i5ig/us_airmen_aaron_bushnell_has_died_after_setting/ks7urra,53.45247446975648,-0.9409,6.115892125483034,0,-1,-1,3

The experience in Palestine was absolutely amazing, especially as an American Jew. Welcomed everywhere I went, people were genuinely friendly and willing to show us around their towns without expectation that we would pay them (the tour guide scam). So many fantastic family dinners, big spreads of food, great discussions. It was life-changing.

My most eye-opening experience was how pretty much every Palestinian would openly welcome Jews or even Israelis, but condemned the Zionist agenda that occupies Palestine. Even in Hebron when the Israeli forces started tear gassing and shooting and we all fled into a shop to hide, I was a bit shell-shocked and started to confuse Hebrew words into my Arabic, to the point where the shopkeeper obviously knew I was Hebrew-speaking when I used the Hebrew word for bread (""le5em"") instead of the Arabic word (""5ubez""- the Hebrew word meant ""meat"" even though I was trying to say ""bread""). The shopkeeper's eyes opened wide, he reached out and shook my hand, and said that anybody that would stand with Palestinians is welcome in his shop. The overwhelming amount of humanity and humility taught me lessons I'll never forget.

On the contrary, Israelis treated me great when they figured I was in their ethnic group. It changed a bit when they learned I was ethnically part-Arab.

Writing my thoughts on what Aaron might have meant because a few people here have made queries in the comments: 

I think he’s recognizing his racial identity and its roots in imperialism, genocidal settler-colonialism, and white supremacy—established yt Americans aren’t native to the U.S. and they’ve long since departed from their European roots. Colonialists are spiritually, culturally, and psychologically “landless” in a sense of having lost identity, home, heritage, and their humanity after having stolen it from another. It’s no wonder yt people are so obsessed with fetishizing cultures throughout the world. They’re chasing after a fundamental human need of origin, home, and selfhood they’ve relinquished by committing such profound evil. They don’t belong anywhere and they’ve lost any real claim to doing so. In uprooting other people they’ve uprooted themselves. Colonialists lose their right to any part of the world and systematically gridlock their descendants in the same trap. As a descendent of such people historically and a member of people currently pursuing this violence, I think Aaron likely felt all of this and was trying to stand up to it and call for finally putting it to an end.

I don’t condone or actively support self-immolation, but do respect it as an act of extreme protest. All that being said, here’s a real example of a yt person taking responsibility, having moral culpability, facing history, and not cowering from having to do so like I’ve seen in the faces of so many yt people who express discomfort, weakness, contempt, or malicious rebukes at having to do any of the above. This was an act of high courage, virtue, and pure goodness. Rest in power Aaron!! You’ve challenged the course of human history for nearly the last millennia through your most profound sacrifice!!! Here’s the finale to the rot of western colonialism, hegemony, and white supremacy!! Viva viva Palestina!!! We’re not liberating Palestine, Palestine is liberating all of us!!! Palestinian liberation is human liberation!!! Let’s keep it up for all Palestinians, all oppressed people, and for both Aaron and fellow activists who by being Brown, women, etc. go unknown to social media and the public while also having committed the act of self-immolation.

ln3t79p,2024-09-14 16:35:36,Palestine,Palestine,1fgo4j5,"What protesting, BDS movement and speaking up for Palestine got so far?","A lot of people are highly critical of the effectiveness of BDS (I realise this is not OP's message). 

It is true, typically, that the lower the level of activity, the less impact will be generated.

Protests are weaker than civil disobedience, which is weaker than direct action, which is weaker than rioting, which is weaker than political violence.

This is not to say the more violent forms are better, just that - historically - these are what cause a greater political response.

However, protests, when done effectively, can build greater awareness of problems and a growing grassroots swell of pressure for political change.

The media coverage of the Gaza crisis was so weak that for months the average person was unaware of the severity of the events taking place - and many of those who did see news, were told only the Israeli perspective on 7th October. That changed with the widespread university protests, these led to a new, bigger wave of street protests. These in turn brought the support of several well known celebrities to the cause, then individual politicians, and eventually world leaders, speaking at the United Nations. This is all building towards official recognition of Palestinian statehood.

Without the initial small-scale protests this probably would not have occurred.

BDS is the same, its pressure builds slowly and, when it reaches a certain tipping point, is capable of a rapid surge that can bring about major change. This is what happened with South Africa, and, though not guaranteed, it has the potential to do the same against Israel.

All struggles for freedom and justice against a more powerful opponent can seem hopeless at times. At present the crimes against the Palestinian people have never been worse (far more have died than even during the Nakba), but support for Palestine among the common people of the world has never been more widespread.","a lot of people are highly critical of the effectiveness of bds i realise this is not op s message . it is true, typically, that the lower the level of activity, the less impact will be generated. protests are weaker than civil disobedience, which is weaker than direct action, which is weaker than rioting, which is weaker than political violence. this is not to say the more violent forms are better, just that historically these are what because a greater political response. however, protests, when done effectively, can build greater awareness of problems and a growing grassroots swell of pressure for political change. the media coverage of the gaza crisis was so weak that for months the average person was unaware of the severity of the events taking place and many of those who did see news, were told only the israeli perspective on 7th october. that changed with the widespread university protests, these led to a new, bigger wave of street protests. these in turn brought the support of several well known celebrities to the because, then individual politicians, and eventually world leaders, speaking at the united nations. this is all building towards official recognition of palestinian statehood. without the initial small scale protests this probably would not have occurred. bds is the same, its pressure builds slowly and, when it reaches a certain tipping point, is capable of a rapid surge that can bring about major change. this is what happened with south africa, and, though not guaranteed, it has the potential to do the same against israel. all struggles for freedom and justice against a more powerful opponent can seem hopeless at times. at present the crimes against the palestinian people have never been worse far more have died than even during the nakba , but support for palestine among the common people of the world has never been more widespread.","lot people highly critical effectiveness bds realise op message . true, typically, lower level activity, less impact generated. protests weaker civil disobedience, weaker direct action, weaker rioting, weaker political violence. say violent forms better, historically greater political response. however, protests, done effectively, build greater awareness problems growing grassroots swell pressure political change. media coverage gaza crisis weak months average person unaware severity events taking place many see news, told israeli perspective 7th october. changed widespread university protests, led new, bigger wave street protests. turn brought support several well known celebrities because, individual politicians, eventually world leaders, speaking united nations. building towards official recognition palestinian statehood. without initial small scale protests probably would occurred. bds same, pressure builds slowly and, reaches certain tipping point, capable rapid surge bring major change. happened south africa, and, though guaranteed, potential israel. struggles freedom justice powerful opponent seem hopeless times. present crimes palestinian people never worse far died even nakba , support palestine among common people world never widespread.",65,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1fgo4j5/what_protesting_bds_movement_and_speaking_up_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1fgo4j5/what_protesting_bds_movement_and_speaking_up_for/ln3t79p,49.19420356001825,-0.6491,4.174387269895637,0,-1,-1,4

Translation:

*Atok (Grandfather), Can you cook fried rice for... hmmmph*

*(puts on Keffiyeh Bandana)*

*Ok, Let's go.*

*Start by heating up the wok until it becomes oily*

*then 5 Kilograms of cooking oil*

*then add garlic, SMASH, (smashes table) - (""cincaaaaang"") cut to pieces*

*and then stir-fry (kacau-kacau) mix-mix*

*then add 1 kilogram of chili and then, SMASH (smashes table) -  (""cincaaaaang"") cut to pieces*

*then add a piece of egg (although he said ""telur-mu"" which means ""your egg"", cheeky bugger)*

*break it and then throw (sound effects)*

*then (kacau-kacau) mix-mix (he pronounced it in a funny way, ka-chow! ka-chow!)*

*then add a ladle of vegetable, (stale) rice (he says nasi-something, that sounds like ""bestie"" could also a play of words for ""basi"" which means ""stale"". Throw (sound effects)*

*then ka-chow! ka-chow! ka-chow! ka-chow! (ladle-fighting intensifies)*

*then add oyster sauce, chili sauce, soy-sauce,*

*ADD A TABLE SPOON OF ZAQQUM!!! (When you know , you know)*

*salt, Ajinomoto (A Japanese MSG salt, though he pronounce it as Aji-no-Mantra, which is a play of words, kind of mean ""magic spell"" or ""hocus-pocus"" )*

*Then ka-chow! with FIRE until it reach the brim, ka-chow!, ka-chow!*

*and...READY*

*then throw onto a plate that's ready*

*There it is, FRIED RICE YAHUDI*

*Then - (Throws it into a bin)*

&#x200B;

""Kacau"" means ""Mix"" in Malay but in Indonesian, could also mean ""chaos"".

July 7, 2024 ","So happy about it. A lot of us voted New popular front and La France Insoumise (LFI) for their position on Palestine, on top of being the most humanist and real leftist party in France.

The official position is 2 state solution but that is just the beginning. Like Rima Hassan said, our newly minted Franco Palestinian European deputy, this is to follow international law and demand an immediate and permanent ceasefire. But ideally, she also wants one state with bi nationality in the future. But France recognising Palestine will be a huge step and pressure on Israel.

There were also talks about stopping all military contracts with Israel and prosecuting Franco-Israeli soldiers that are coming back from Gaza. France is the 2nd after USA to provide overseas soldiers to Israel.

Our country and media are insanely pro Israel, heavily censoring and attacking any pro pal voices.  Recently, Netanyahu made a president style announcement on our national TV to talk about “our victory” as westerners on Palestinians. It was disgusting.

Our LFI MPs were also the ones waving Palestinian flags in the parliament, getting sanctioned for it, and constantly talking about Palestine. They have now with a relative majority and I am very optimistic they will keep all their promises on Palestine.","so happy about it. a lot of us voted new popular front and la france insoumise lfi for their position on palestine, on top of being the most humanist and real leftist party in france. the official position is 2 state solution but that is just the beginning. like rima hassan said, our newly minted franco palestinian european deputy, this is to follow international law and demand an immediate and permanent ceasefire. but ideally, she also wants one state with bi nationality in the future. but france recognising palestine will be a huge step and pressure on israel. there were also talks about stopping all military contracts with israel and prosecuting franco israeli soldiers that are coming back from gaza. france is the 2nd after usa to provide overseas soldiers to israel. our country and media are insanely pro israel, heavily censoring and attacking any pro pal voices. recently, netanyahu made a president style announcement on our national tv to talk about our victory as westerners on palestinians. it was disgusting. our lfi mps were also the ones waving palestinian flags in the parliament, getting sanctioned for it, and constantly talking about palestine. they have now with a relative majority and i am very optimistic they will keep all their promises on palestine.","happy it. lot us voted new popular front la france insoumise lfi position palestine, top humanist real leftist party france. official position 2 state solution beginning. like rima hassan said, newly minted franco palestinian european deputy, follow international law demand immediate permanent ceasefire. ideally, also wants one state bi nationality future. france recognising palestine huge step pressure israel. also talks stopping military contracts israel prosecuting franco israeli soldiers coming back gaza. france 2nd usa provide overseas soldiers israel. country media insanely pro israel, heavily censoring attacking pro pal voices. recently, netanyahu made president style announcement national tv talk victory westerners palestinians. disgusting. lfi mps also ones waving palestinian flags parliament, getting sanctioned it, constantly talking palestine. relative majority optimistic keep promises palestine.",39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1dxpmdo/france_elections_winners_promise_to_recognize/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1dxpmdo/france_elections_winners_promise_to_recognize/lc4fg5a,42.67569519682196,0.8375,3.6635616461296463,8,-1,-1,5

Here are a few excerpts from memoirs that refer to Palestine by name:

Rescued from the Ashes (Leokadia Schmidt):
We were very sorry for Mr. Rosenpick, a very wise and cultured gentleman. He would always tell my husband, “We European Jews are condemned to extinction, but a new Jewish nation will arise in Palestine out of those who are saved and from the Jews of North and South America.”

Among the Reeds (Tammy Bottner):
There were many different sects of Jews in the city: Hassidim with their long black coats and curly sideburns, modern Reform Jews, and a Zionist community that longed for the formation of a modern Jewish state in Palestine.

...As soon as the first warmth of spring coaxed the daffodils out, we left. That is when we started our journey toward Palestine. The land of Israel was still not established, but we went anyway. We had heard about how austerely the Jews lived in Palestine.

...Eventually my cousin Miriam, Tante Paula’s daughter, who was a native of Palestine, came and vouched for us, and we were released.

...At the end of World War One, the British, victorious over the Ottoman Empire – which had fought on the German side – ousted the Turks and assumed control over much of the Middle East, including the area called Palestine.

Night (Elie Wiesel):
We also spoke often about Palestine. Their parents, like mine, had not had the courage to sell everything and emigrate while there was still time.

Alicia (Alicia Appleman-Jurman)
Eretz Israel, which the world knew as Palestine, was  governed by England under a mandate from the old League of Nations. Bevin had issued a “white paper” that drastically limited the entry of Jews into Palestine despite the fact that the English government had, in its Balfour Declaration of 1917, promised that a Jewish homeland would be developed there. The reason for this was that England desired to pacify the Arab world, which strongly opposed such a Jewish homeland. At the rate this “white paper” was allowing immigration into Palestine, we would have to wait ten years to get there, and this was, of course, out of the question.","what is even more ridiculous is that there are several holocaust survivor memoirs that explicitly mention trying to get to or wanting to go to palestine. here are a few excerpts from memoirs that refer to palestine by name rescued from the ashes leokadia schmidt we were very sorry for mr. rosenpick, a very wise and cultured gentleman. he would always tell my husband, we european jews are condemned to extinction, but a new jewish nation will arise in palestine out of those who are saved and from the jews of north and south america. among the reeds tammy bottner there were many different sects of jews in the city hassidim with their long black coats and curly sideburns, modern reform jews, and a zionist community that longed for the formation of a modern jewish state in palestine. ...as soon as the first warmth of spring coaxed the daffodils out, we left. that is when we started our journey toward palestine. the land of israel was still not established, but we went anyway. we had heard about how austerely the jews lived in palestine. ...eventually my cousin miriam, tante paula s daughter, who was a native of palestine, came and vouched for us, and we were released. ...at the end of world war one, the british, victorious over the ottoman empire which had fought on the german side ousted the turks and assumed control over much of the middle east, including the area called palestine. night elie wiesel we also spoke often about palestine. their parents, like mine, had not had the courage to sell everything and emigrate while there was still time. alicia alicia appleman jurman eretz israel, which the world knew as palestine, was governed by england under a mandate from the old league of nations. bevin had issued a white paper that drastically limited the entry of jews into palestine despite the fact that the english government had, in its balfour declaration of 1917, promised that a jewish homeland would be developed there. the reason for this was that england desired to pacify the arab world, which strongly opposed such a jewish homeland. at the rate this white paper was allowing immigration into palestine, we would have to wait ten years to get there, and this was, of course, out of the question.","even ridiculous several holocaust survivor memoirs explicitly mention trying get wanting go palestine. excerpts memoirs refer palestine name rescued ashes leokadia schmidt sorry mr. rosenpick, wise cultured gentleman. would always tell husband, european jews condemned extinction, new jewish nation arise palestine saved jews north south america. among reeds tammy bottner many different sects jews city hassidim long black coats curly sideburns, modern reform jews, zionist community longed formation modern jewish state palestine. ...as soon first warmth spring coaxed daffodils out, left. started journey toward palestine. land israel still established, went anyway. heard austerely jews lived palestine. ...eventually cousin miriam, tante paula daughter, native palestine, came vouched us, released. ...at end world war one, british, victorious ottoman empire fought german side ousted turks assumed control much middle east, including area called palestine. night elie wiesel also spoke often palestine. parents, like mine, courage sell everything emigrate still time. alicia alicia appleman jurman eretz israel, world knew palestine, governed england mandate old league nations. bevin issued white paper drastically limited entry jews palestine despite fact english government had, balfour declaration 1917, promised jewish homeland would developed there. reason england desired pacify arab world, strongly opposed jewish homeland. rate white paper allowing immigration palestine, would wait ten years get there, was, course, question.",50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1coefvf/the_name_palestine_has_existed_for_3000_years/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1coefvf/the_name_palestine_has_existed_for_3000_years/l3edfom,36.08967716221602,0.7279,3.912023005428146,8,-1,-1,5

Everyone at the camp is fine, no one was hurt. The police were able to arrest the arsonist. He was later released and is only being charged for ""destruction of property by means of arson"" (sorry, translated directly from German ""Sachbeschädigung durch Brandstiftung""). He has not faced charges related to hate crimes and he is, for now, a free man. The news went viral in Germany, and I heard on the radio that the prosecutor suspects anti-muslim motives.

This is a slap in the face to all pro-Palestinian voices in Germany, but it is hardly surprising when considering Germany's ongoing medial and political repression and vilification of Palestinians, Arabs and immigrants.

luhcafe,2024-10-30 06:11:48,Palestine,Palestine,1gf17q1,"A demonstration was held in Hachiko Square, Tokyo, in solidarity with Palestine, denouncing the ongoing Israeli genocide in Gaza.","It is good to see active demos in the city where I live but sadly very few of these are connected to other more organized forms or protest, e.g. targeting politicians, journalists, and academics with influence/accountability campaigns, raising awareness among businesses in the area surrounding the Israeli embassy, highlighting the Japanese elements of BDS, etc. 

I've reached out in person and indirectly to people involved in protests like the one above and invariably they have shown no interest in expanding beyond simple group demos, which are better than nothing but far less than whats possible.

Worth noting that some 56 years ago in 1968, 20,000 Japanese students engaged in a full-scale battle at Shinjuku train station against the Tokyo riot police in a protest against the Vietnam war. Violence in present-day Japan would be utterly counter-productive (and serve only to tarnish all protest) but it would be nice to see the same level of passion that previous generations had for resisting warmongers.","it is good to see active demos in the city where i live but sadly very few of these are connected to other more organized forms or protest, e.g. targeting politicians, journalists, and academics with influence accountability campaigns, raising awareness among businesses in the area surrounding the israeli embassy, highlighting the japanese elements of bds, etc. i have reached out in person and indirectly to people involved in protests like the one above and invariably they have shown no interest in expanding beyond simple group demos, which are better than nothing but far less than what is possible. worth noting that some 56 years ago in 1968, 20,000 japanese students engaged in a full scale battle at shinjuku train station against the tokyo riot police in a protest against the vietnam war. violence in present day japan would be utterly counter productive and serve only to tarnish all protest but it would be nice to see the same level of passion that previous generations had for resisting warmongers.","good see active demos city live sadly connected organized forms protest, e.g. targeting politicians, journalists, academics influence accountability campaigns, raising awareness among businesses area surrounding israeli embassy, highlighting japanese elements bds, etc. reached person indirectly people involved protests like one invariably shown interest expanding beyond simple group demos, better nothing far less possible. worth noting 56 years ago 1968, 20,000 japanese students engaged full scale battle shinjuku train station tokyo riot police protest vietnam war. violence present day japan would utterly counter productive serve tarnish protest would nice see level passion previous generations resisting warmongers.",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1gf17q1/a_demonstration_was_held_in_hachiko_square_tokyo/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1gf17q1/a_demonstration_was_held_in_hachiko_square_tokyo/luhcafe,57.15686274509804,-0.9594,1.791759469228055,4,-1,-1,6
