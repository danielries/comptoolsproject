2024-10-27 18:38:06,politics,Israel,1gdcy25,lu1sukf,Bernie Sanders to voters skipping presidential election over Israel: ‘Trump is even worse’,"This is just objectively true.

&nbsp;

If you support Harris:

* We will probably get the same status quo Israel loving government we have had for the last 60+ years, but they might at least *try* to curb things.

If you support Trump:

* You will get the same situation in Israel-Gaza you have right now, but with them being told to ""finish what they started"" and to consider the nuclear option while on the phone with their leadership ""pretty much every day"" asking them to keep it going to hurt the election.

* You will see Ukraine collapse as Trump pulls aid and funding (which he withheld from Ukraine last time in office) for his buddy Putin, seeing a genocide there.

* You will get a new home-grown genocidal war against the LGBTQ+ citizenry or at the very least see them oppressed into slave-level ""rights"".

* You will see an all out war on anyone the GOP doesn't consider a ""good immigrant"".

* You will see new levels of racism and bigotry from the man who talks about burying ""fucking Mexicans"", ""vermin that are poisoning the lifeblood of the country"", hatred against Asian-Americans from the man who made popular ""kung flu"", and the ""enemy within"" that should apparently have US military used on them. All compiled with a planned Muslim ban and new religious hatred if you are not white evangelical.

* The new war on women, turning them into baby factories who can't divorce their husbands unless another man says that it is okay. Gilead is not something to which we should aspire.

&nbsp;

Please, by all means, criticize the Democratic Party for how they are handled Israel. Very few people are going to disagree that it's a shit-show.

Edit: Adding a couple things since this comment blew up. First, if you care about Palestine, when the alternative is Donald Trump, Biden is clearly the candidate better equipped to stop the violence. Not voting makes you part of the problem. 

Second, while I acknowledge Tik Tok has lots of issues (Reddit does too), it’s still probably the #1 platform to reach Gen Z. The Biden campaign desperately needs to win them back  not just for votes but for building a long-term coalition of leftist voters.

Third, all these “Gen Z is stupid” or “Zoomers are brainless” comments are unhelpful. Let’s not forget they voted for Biden at a higher margin than any generation in 2020. In 2022, they voted at a higher percentage than Millennials or Gen X for their first midterm election. They are young and figuring things out and just trying to fit in.

> The IDF officers involved “misidentified something slung over one of the passenger’s shoulders as a weapon,” but forces now believe it was a bag, an IDF spokesperson told CNN Friday.

How many innocent Palestinian civilians have been killed over a ""misidentified bag"" but without the international political pressure to induce scrutiny?

There is no way in hell that the first time the IDF ""accidentally"" triple tapped a target to ensure they killed everyone over a bag, they happened to hit a convoy of foreign aid workers travelling on a pre-coordinated route. This sort of shit only happens when there's an institutional culture that says the merest hint of a terrorist justifies eliminating every civilian in the area.

All that - while our money is spent on weapons for both those countries instead of on our own education and healthcare.  Instead, we are subsidizing theirs.

So let’s not kid ourselves.

The party of ""no"" sure is a party of ""yes"" when it comes to batshit-crazy, huh?

> When moderator Kristen Welker pointed out to Graham that Republican former President Ronald Reagan withheld weapons shipments to Israel in the 1980s during its conflict with Lebanon, Graham returned to World War II.

Reagan used his power to influence Israeli war policy multiple times. 

Indeed, there were several instances where Reagan ordered warplanes and munitions to be delayed because they were going to be used against civilians and in ways America did not approve. 

And reportedly, the civilian casualties - particularly during the 1982 Lebanon War and when Israel attacked PLO targets - bothered him greatly and he found it deeply upsetting. Even writing of his disgust and the need to influence Israel in his diary.

For Reagan, the civilian casualties were an impetus for action as much as any other political reasons.

And Reagan wasn't the only Republican to play hardball with Israel...

Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened economic sanctions and an aid cutoff to force Israel to withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula after it invaded Egypt in 1956. 

Gerald R. Ford warned that he would re-evaluate the entire relationship in 1975 over what he considered Israel’s recalcitrance during peace talks with Egypt.

President Joe Biden said Thursday that the weekslong pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses haven’t changed his policy stance on Israel and the Middle East.

In his strongest direct remarks yet on the escalating protests, Biden criticized some of the protests as “not peaceful,” saying that they had disrupted classes and upcoming graduation ceremonies, and that vandalizing, trespassing, and occupying campus buildings wasn’t considered free speech.

“Violent protest in America is not protected. Peaceful protest is,” Biden said at the White House.

2024-05-02 23:10:16,politics,Israel,1ciijem,l2bhrs1,Biden says campus unrest hasn’t changed his mind about Israel policy,"Everyone arguing and not a single person posting the full speech:

>Good morning.  Before I head to North Carolina, I wanted to speak for a few moments about what's going on on our college campuses here.  We've all seen images and they put to the test two fundamental American principles.  First is the right to free speech and for people to peacefully assemble and make their voices heard.  The second is the rule of law.  Both must be upheld.  

>We are not an authoritarian nation where we silence people or squash dissent.  The American people are heard.  In fact, peaceful protest is in the best American tradition of how Americans respond to consequential issues.  But - but - neither are we a lawless country.  We're a civil society, and order must prevail.  Throughout our history we've often faced moments like this because we are a big, diverse, free-thinking and freedom-loving nation.  In moments like this, there are always those who rush in to score political points.  But this isn't a moment for politics, it's a moment for clarity.  

>So let me be clear: peaceful protest in America - violent protest is not protected, peaceful protest is.  It's against the law when violence occurs; destroying property is not a peaceful protest it's against the law.  Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campuses, forcing the cancellation of classes and graduation, none of this is a peaceful protest.  Threatening people, intimidating people, instilling fear in people is not a peaceful protest, it's against the law.  Dissent is essential to democracy, but dissent must never lead to disorder or to denying the rights of other students can finish the semester and their college education.  

>Look, it's a matter of fairness, it's a matter of what's right.  There's the right to protest, but not the right to cause chaos.  People have the right to get an education, the right to get a degree, the right to walk across the campus safely without the fear of getting attacked.  

>Let's be clear about this as well: there should be no place on any campus, no place in America, for antisemitism or threats of violence against Jewish students.  There is no place for hate speech or violence of any kind, whether it's antisemitism or Islamophobia, or discrimination against Arab-Americans or Palestinian-Americans.  It's simply wrong. There is no place for racism in America; it's all wrong, it's unamerican.  

>I understand people have strong feelings and deep convictions.  In America, we respect the right and protect the right to express that, but it doesn't mean anything goes.  It needs to be done without violence, without destruction, without hate, and within the law.  Make no mistake, as president I will always defend free speech, and I will always be just as strong in standing up for the rule of law.  That's my responsibility to you, the American people, and my obligation to the Constitution.

>Q: 'Have the protests forced you to reconsider any policies with regard to the region?'

>A: ""No.""

2024-01-02 21:56:31,politics,Israel,18x1lfb,kg1cw3h,Bernie Sanders Calls On Congress To Reject Unconditional Military Aid To Israel,"Sen. Bernie Sanders called on Congress Tuesday to reject the $10.1 billion in unconditional military aid to Israel, citing “Netanyahu’s illegal and immoral war against the Palestinian People.” 

In a statement, Sanders said the supplemental funding bill gives aid “for the right-wing Netanyahu government to continue its brutal war against the Palestinian people.” 

“Enough is enough. Congress must reject that funding. The taxpayers of the United States must no longer be complicit in destroying the lives of innocent men, women, and children in Gaza.” Sanders said the issue is complicated, adding that “while we recognize that Hamas’ barbaric terrorist attack began this war, we must also recognize that Israel’s military response has been grossly disproportionate, immoral, and in violation of international law.” 

“And, most importantly for Americans, we must understand that Israel’s war against the Palestinian people has been significantly waged with U.S. bombs, artillery shells, and other forms of weaponry. And the results have been catastrophic.” Sanders, one of the first members of Congress to call for a humanitarian pause, is now one of the first to call for the end to unconditional aid to Israel.",1094,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/18x1lfb/bernie_sanders_calls_on_congress_to_reject/,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/18x1lfb/bernie_sanders_calls_on_congress_to_reject/kg1cw3h

2023-11-14 16:47:05,politics,Israel,17v5atv,k98d6y9,Biden administration staff sign open letter demanding cease-fire in Israel-Hamas war,"For everyone asking what Israel is supposed to do, look at how America operated once we had a presence established in the ME. There were obviously instances of collateral damage, we aren't perfect and war is hard, but there was a concerted effort to prevent civilian losses when feasible.

Israel wants to move in foot troops, conduct investigations and interviews, vet information and conduct targeted small-scope raids against Hamas operational centers and kill/arrest operatives? Fine. Sometimes those actions will also be bombing with the potential for civilian casualties, I don't think anyone reasonable expects the civilian toll to be literally zero.

2023-11-05 14:24:43,politics,Israel,17od07z,k7xh61r,White House frustrated by Israel’s onslaught but sees few options,"As Israel’s ground invasion of Gaza escalates, the Biden administration finds itself in a precarious position: Administration officials say Israel’s counterattack against Hamas has been too severe, too costly in civilian casualties, and lacking a coherent endgame, but they are unable to exert significant influence on America’s closest ally in the Middle East to change its course.

U.S. efforts to get Israel to scale back its counterattack in response to the Oct. 7 killings by Hamas that left at least 1,400 Israelis dead have failed or fallen short. The Biden administration [urged Israel against a ground invasion,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/10/27/us-urging-israel-rethinkg-gaza-ground-invasion/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4) privately asked it to consider proportionality in its attacks, advocated a higher priority on avoiding civilian deaths, and [called for a humanitarian pause](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/10/27/gaza-israel-humanitarian-pause/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4) — only for Israeli officials to dismiss or reject all those suggestions.

That has left the Biden administration urgently seeking to temper anger in the Arab world by making clear, publicly and privately, that the United States is deeply distressed by the suffering in Gaza, a densely populated land strip of more than 2 million people, about half of whom are children. But there is little indication that Arab leaders are moved by these assurances, leaving the shape of the Middle East after the war — and the U.S. role in it — highly uncertain.

“It’s important for the administration to be loud in their concern for the humanitarian toll,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “I understand they don’t want to open up any public space between the United States and Israel. But if we all want to prevent another front from opening up and we want the Gulf states to be part of the reconstruction of Gaza, then we need to make as clear as possible that the United States is prioritizing reduction in civilian harm.”

Murphy recently issued a public statement declaring the current rate of civilian deaths “unacceptable” and urging Israel to shift course. “The administration has been pressing really hard privately,” Murphy said. “And I think they’ve got to be even louder publicly in their concerns about the civilian cost, even while they support Israel’s ability to continue to perpetuate the war.”

The White House declined to comment for this article. A spokesperson pointed to previous comments by national security adviser Jake Sullivan saying that Hamas’s use of Palestinian civilians as human shields does not lessen Israel’s responsibility to do everything possible to minimize civilian casualties.

Netanyahu is the asshole in the middle of all this and is screweing everyone over to prolong the war.  He's screwing over Israel by not prioritizing bringing the hostages home, turning Israel into a pariah state internationally by indiscriminately killing civilians, and by trifling with its most loyal allies' trust.  It's screwing over America by refusing to listen to ANYTHING the US says and dismissing all criticism of its depravity as anti-semitism.


Everyone's problems get smaller if Netanyahu is in the Hague trying to defend himself instead of trying to prolong Israel's one-sided war so he doesn't face consequences for failing to prevent the October attacks despite advance warning from allies.  Netanyahu wants Israelis to be so focused on the war that they forget about how much he failed his people.",79,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1d5uv24/netanyahu_says_no_gaza_ceasefire_until_israels/,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1d5uv24/netanyahu_says_no_gaza_ceasefire_until_israels/l6oqoye

It’s obvious that Israel is behaving monstrously to the civilian population, even if it doesn’t meet the technical terms required to be classified as genocide. Videos of the IDF shooting people with white flags, blowing up their own troops because they’re demolishing empty houses, posting videos of themselves knocking on doors to ruined buildings and cracking jokes, they’re everywhere, and the death toll is staggering for how long this has been going on. 

I’d be happy for Hamas to be gone, but Israel is just making recruitment posters for the next generation who knows fully that they can be wiped off the map with very little recourse while the world largely shrugs in apathy.  We know the cycle of civilian radicalization to extremist orgs. And to America’s very scant credit, they’ve tried to mewl this idea to Israel who have clearly just wanted us to shut up and keep meekly supplying them.

Hamas is a terrorist organization and is a major reason that the Oslo Accords fell through which would have made it far better for Palestine than the current situation. You cannot ensure the actual propsperity of the Palestinian people by legitimizing Hamas. The fact that over 50% of Gaza Palestinians and over 80% of West Bank Palestinians support Hamas (even when Hamas had for over a decade used the Palestinian people for their own gain while pushing Israel to be more extreme against Palestinians) really makes it hard for me. Im 100% about humanity and the safety and security of innocent Palestinian and Israeli people but the fact that Hamas is so popular evem after what everyone has seen on October 7th makes me really disappointed in my fellow average joe liberals who are being utilized as a ad hoc mouth peave for Hamas.

> WASHINGTON - Sen. Bernie Sanders is preparing several resolutions that would stop more than $20 billion in U.S. arms sales to Israel, a longshot effort but the most substantive pushback yet from Congress over the devastation in Gaza ahead of the first year anniversary of the Israel-Hamas war.

> In a letter to Senate colleagues on Wednesday, Sanders said the U.S. cannot be &quot;Complicit in this humanitarian disaster.&quot; The action would force an eventual vote to block the arms sales to Israel, though majority passage is highly unlikely.

> As the war grinds toward a second year, and with the outcome of President Joe Biden&#039;s efforts to broker a cease-fire deal and hostage release uncertain, the resolutions from Sanders would seek to reign in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#039;s assault on Gaza.

Apparently it is now ok to admit this.

Edit: thanks for the upvotes - it gives some satisfaction because for years as a child  the disconnect between the reality I heard at home and what I was taught at school, the snarky comments of schoolmates,  was very disturbing for a first generation American.

39000 people is not recompense for 1000 Israeli citizens. Even if ***half*** of that number was Hamas fighters (it isn't by all accounts), it wouldn't make it right.

We all bare some responsibility, and while I don't condemn Biden, or think it means people should vote against him, we need to do all the reasonable things we can to stop the bloodshed, and bring both sides to the table to create an arrangement for this horror to stop. We cannot force Israel or Hamas to agree, but we can tell Israel that it will lose us as a *material* ally if it will not abide by the *basic rules* we all agreed on as part of the UN Charter.

I don't want my taxes going to support the murder of *even more* innocent men women and children with the *pinky swear that they were bad guys trust us* from Bibi. The trust has been breached time and again. Every time they tell us they will be measured, another hundred people are killed and they can't even tell us who or why.

It is not antisemitic to ask for this conflict to end, and for Israel to respect the human rights of the *innocent* people of Gaza. ""Do you condemn Hamas?"" Of course ... only a fool wouldn't condemn Hamas. But saying that Hamas is evil does not give a green light to the wanton murder we are seeing. You can not tell me that murdering 10 kids to get one guy with an AK, or leveling a city block because of a half translated report of someone who you *think* has the last name of a terrorist, is a war that is reasonable or responsible.

On August 12, the IDF launched a massive barrage of West Beirut that became to be known as Black Thursday, resulting in the death of around 300 people. President Reagan called Begin and demanded that the bombing ceased. It was apparent from the tone of the conversation that the president was overwhelmed. He told Begin that, “Here, on our television, night after night, our people are being shown the symbols of this war and it is a holocaust.” President Reagan used the word ""Holocaust"" deliberately, fully aware of its emotional impact on Prime Minister Begin. He demanded that the bombing cease, since “our entire future relations are at stake if this continues.” Prime Minister Begin promised the president to halt the bombing, which the IDF ultimately did.",85,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/18po3ic/biden_says_he_did_not_ask_for_ceasefire_in_call/,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/18po3ic/biden_says_he_did_not_ask_for_ceasefire_in_call/kephzs8

He doesn't believe a ceasefire is workable, because Hamas is notoriously unreliable in that respect.  And he's right.

But he also doesn't want to see blanket bombing, even though he admits we know Hamas has been practically advertising how they exist in the same buildings as innocent Palestinians.

So, nobody has answers here yet, he just wants to try and save more innocents.

The far left/Palestine side is either voting for Biden or throwing their vote away, that’s all they can do because Trump would be infinitely worse for Palestine than Biden (this side pretends this isn’t true but that’s mostly obstinacy). They are a positive or a neutral. +1 or +0.

The Pro-Israel/Jewish side however has a broader scope that makes them more important to please because they can either support Biden (+1), do nothing (+0) OR they could vote for Trump (-1)

Biden has multiple interests to please and satisfy, and coming out hard against Israel could LOSE him votes and at the same time GIVE votes to Trump, not to mention money and rhetorical ammunition.

2024-04-13 21:52:38,politics,Israel,1c3d02s,kzg2fu6,Statement from NSC Spokesperson Adrienne Watson on Attacks Against Israel,"To all those, namely conservatives, who have already jumped to the conclusion that this means World War III, and above all else, because this is what's most important to them, Joe Biden is solely responsible for it, I say...

Part of me wants to laugh, but the other part feels frustrated that there are Americans who think this way.

They are a vocal minority no doubt, but it's still concerning.

Because it's apparent that these people have no regard for important historical context, for the various factors that have all contributed, over the course of almost a century now, to the current conflict in Israel and consequently, across the middle East. 

To quote a meandering, arrogant, pseudo-intellectual conservative by the name of Ben Shapiro, ""facts don't care about your feelings.""

And that's all these types of comments are informed by, feelings.

You're ignoring or you are ignorant of a complicated history in the Middle East stretching back to the Balfour Declaration, the end of WW1, while some historians would argue, the late 19th century author/journalist, Theodore Herzl and his publication of ""Der Judenstaat.""

You're ignoring decades of geopolitics, world affairs and international relations, an Israeli/Palestinian conflict that has endured for almost a century now, the history of the Iranian revolution and all that's taken place since, a persistent conflict in Syria that has become a theater of war and hostilities for multiple nations across the globe, Middle East affairs in general, The United Nations involvement in some of these conflicts, Israel's more recent political history involving a strong man persona who has built a far right coalition in Israel that supports the collective punishment of the Palestinian people, as well as the gradual disposession of their land, and of course, America's own historical and ongoing foreign relationship with these nations and their political affairs.

Joe Biden is just a miniscule piece of the puzzle in relationship to this broader regional conflict

You're also ignoring the role that past administration's have played in either exacerbating these conflicts, in establishing or dismantling alliances, in making compromises and in some cases, failed attempts at peace efforts. 

Joe Biden did not start WWIII, in fact, conservatives seem to be more interested in encouraging such a war than anything else, so they can justify such a profoundly ignorant accusation that Joe Biden, equal parts dementia and criminal mastermind, is responsible for every conceivable global conflict. 

The actions that some of these social media foreign policy experts are vaguely advocating for, are not going to change the important fact that this regional conflict and its history are complicated. There is no catch-all solution, Joe Biden cannot flick his wrist and change its trajectory. 

It's also a multinational conflict that requires comprehensive considerations from our leaders before any action can be taken. 

Biden has communicated his support for Palestinian civilians and refugees, but the U.S. and Israel have been politically and strategically entangled for so long, that it's not as simple as just letting go of an important ally, or threatening to, on the off chance that it doesn't make things even more complicated. Netanyahu doesn't respond to aggressive maneuvers very diplomatically. Keep in mind also, that Netanyahu has benefitted throughout his political career from playing the strongman and sustaining a volatile and violent conflict in the region to remain in power. 

The U.S has leverage over the Israeli government, but it works both ways. Especially when Netanyahu has recently made a bigger political ally out of the Republican party, who cares little for the plight of Palestinians because many conservatives have simply lumped them in with all terrorists. Any effort from Biden to push hard against Netanyahu, will be met with an equal, but opposite reaction. And you better believe Republicans will capitalize off of it and make it part of their 2024 platform. But let's not go too far off tangent.

Biden is caught between a rock and a hard place. There's quite a few Conservatives who tend to become isolationists when it's beneficial for them, but blame Biden for both not doing enough or getting involved in most any capacity, there's no winning strategy here. The reality is, it's a series of historical, previous relations with countries like Israel and Iran in particular that put us in this foreign policy predicament, not the actions of a single current president. The U.S. and the middle East are separated by a vast expanse of ocean, but are regions tied together by these past alliances, conflicts, political and strategic relationships, ties that existed well before Biden took office. In other words, this dilemma, is likely one that any president would have had to face coming into this most recent term. This should be obvious enough, but for some, it isn't

I would suggest you incendiary critics inform yourselves and try, at the very least, to reflect on your motivations here, your prejudices and preconceptions, where you obtained them, and why you support these kinds of very short sighted, unnuanced, blatantly partisan and misinformed oversimplifications.

I would suggest it, yes, but I know such a suggestion would go over your head, or would fall on deaf ears. 

This is what I've come to expect of a vocal minority of agitators, contrarians and fanatics who are mindlessly adherent to one group, party, ideology or person, speaking in black and white terms, generalizations and preconceived ideas riddled with bias and prejudice,

2024-01-16 13:36:33,politics,Israel,19831j6,ki4dgj8,Bernie Sanders to force vote on Israel’s human rights practices in Gaza,"Senators on Tuesday will vote on whether to require the Biden administration to look into potential human rights abuses perpetrated by Israel in its military campaign in Gaza.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), an independent who caucuses with Democrats, is forcing the politically tricky vote using a mechanism in U.S. foreign assistance law that requires the State Department to look into human rights practices of nations receiving U.S. aid. If passed, the resolution would require the department to produce a report within 30 days about any potential abuses and how U.S. weapons have been used in Gaza.

The resolution would not alter U.S. aid to Israel, but it is still facing opposition from the Biden administration and many Democrats, who have raised concerns about the message the vote would send.

“We are trying to call attention to some unpleasant realities that I think a lot of people would prefer not to deal with,” Sanders said in an interview.

>""Debate about whether U.S. security assistance to foreign countries should be conditioned upon human rights criteria discounts a simple fact. U.S. law is clear: all countries receiving U.S. aid must meet human rights standards, and countries violating these standards are liable to be sanctioned and ineligible for U.S. funding:  
>  
>The Foreign Assistance Act (P.L. 87–195) regulates all forms of U.S. assistance to foreign countries. It states that no assistance may be provided to a country “which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.”  
>  
>The Arms Export Control Act (P.L. 90–629) regulates U.S. military assistance and sales to foreign countries. It states that the United States can furnish weapons to foreign countries “solely for internal security, for legitimate self-defense,” and for a few other limited purposes. No credits, guarantees, sales, or deliveries of weapons can be given to a country if it is “in substantial violation” of these purposes.  
>  
>The Leahy Laws require the Departments of State and Defense to vet individual military units and individuals before they are eligible to receive U.S. equipment or training. The Department of State version of the law states that no form of assistance can be provided “to any unit of the security forces” committing “a gross violation of human rights.” The Department of Defense version states that no training or equipment can be given to a military unit that “has committed a gross violation of human rights.”  
>  
>Another indisputable fact is that the United States has placed conditions on other countries’ FMF. For example, in the FY2021 budget, $225 million of $1.3 billion in FMF for Egypt is withheld from obligation until the Department of State certifies that Egypt is “taking sustained and effective steps” to strengthen human rights.  
>  
>However, when it comes to Israel, additional conditions do not apply and general human rights laws are almost never adhered to. Furthermore, weapons flows to Israel are much less transparent than those to other countries, making implementation of these laws more difficult.

So how the fuck are they continuing to get billions of US tax dollars every year?

And asking for more billions as they're committing ethnic cleansing and war crimes under the pretext of ""self-defense""?

But if anyone questions the arrangement, they're called anti-Semitic or pro-terrorism by AIPAC and the pro-Israel lobby.

Anti-Semitism is an actual problem, and it is disgusting and psychopathic behavior to conflate opposition to Israel's apartheid, ethnic cleansing, and war crimes (illegally funded with [billions of our tax dollars](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2023-10-10/how-much-aid-does-the-u-s-give-to-israel)) with opposition to Jewish people generally.

They use accusations of anti-Semitism to shut down legitimate criticism and debate.

The American people shouldn't tolerate being bullied into silence (and into violating our own laws) by the lobbyists for a foreign government when they're using our tax dollars to fund apartheid, war crimes, and ethnic cleansing abroad, which inevitably blows back on us and our troops as well.",37,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/17nm09x/biden_under_pressure_from_within_his_own_party_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/17nm09x/biden_under_pressure_from_within_his_own_party_to/k7tmf17

Now the hard part about about calling this a genocide is proving intent of Israel to genocide the Palestian people, as so far to my knowledge their stated goal is the eradication of Hamas and for the most part that seems to be true. Civilian casualties in war are regrettable, they should be avoided as much as possible, but they are a grim reality of war nevertheless.

2023-12-10 05:51:55,politics,Israel,18eths2,kcqhn69,VP Harris presses Israel on civilian deaths in Gaza. What does international law say?,"How many tonnes of ordanance did the IDF drop on Gaza in their precision bombing camping against Hamas? Last I heard was around 25k - so 500kg for every potential terrorist, does not seem very targeted more like the ruSSian tactic of simply flattening everything. And they aren't finished ... how many terrorists did the IDF claim to have killed with those 25k tonnes of bombs till now?

Lets not kid ourselfs here - Israeli officals even said the quite part out loud ... multiple times. When you think of all Palestinians as terrorists and at best as 3nd class human beings it's quite easy to justify raising Gaza to the ground.

Btw the amount of people willing to justify this - ""because there is no other way"" is quite amazing but not in a good way.",104,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/18eths2/vp_harris_presses_israel_on_civilian_deaths_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/18eths2/vp_harris_presses_israel_on_civilian_deaths_in/kcqhn69

It’s one of those situations like ISIS in Mosul, where it reached the point that the government decided they cannot coexist, the organization needs to be destroyed block by block if necessary.  

Now… urban combat is notorious for civilian casualties, especially if one side is using human shields.  On the other hand, the government cannot go back to the previous situation where they were just waiting for the other side to attack.

This happened because Dupont lobbied for it as it gives Dupont a complete monopoly on it which made them a lot of money. This single point has been used very effectively against him by opposition candidate General Gantz. Biden cutting off the ammo, even just temporarily, is a major stranglehold on Israeli combat operations. Netanyahu cannot do the wide, intensive campaign he wants without American ammunition resupply. It helps that Netanyahu's coalition also won't commit their own sons to the war or pay taxes for new gunpowder refining, creating an untenable situation for him.

This is Biden's real leverage on Israel and he is aggressively using it. He is preventing Netanyahu from escalating the conflict. It's not a ceasefire, but it's why Israel cannot just annex the West Bank right now. And vice versa, the missiles to Ukraine is the only reason Ukraine is still a country.",236,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1cktosr/us_put_a_hold_on_an_ammunition_shipment_to_israel/,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1cktosr/us_put_a_hold_on_an_ammunition_shipment_to_israel/l2pvdwx

2024-03-14 14:21:30,politics,Israel,1bembli,kuu6sr4,Schumer to call for ‘new election’ in Israel in scathing speech on Netanyahu,"Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) will call for the Israeli government to hold new elections in a speech warning that Israel risked becoming an international “pariah” under the leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing cabinet.

Schumer, the highest-ranking Jewish official in the United States and a staunch ally of Israel’s, is expected to say he thinks Israelis understand “better than anybody that Israel cannot hope to succeed as a pariah opposed by the rest of the world” and would choose better leaders if elections were held.

“I believe that holding a new election once the war starts to wind down would give Israelis an opportunity to express their vision for the postwar future,” Schumer will say in a speech on the Senate floor Thursday, according to prepared remarks that did not set an exact timeline for a new election.

The call marks the clearest signal to Israel yet that frustrations over Netanyahu’s handling of the war in Gaza are boiling over, and have reached the highest echelons of the U.S. government.

President Biden has frequently expressed frustration with Netanyahu in recent months, but has never publicly suggested that Israelis replace him. The prime minister is deeply unpopular at home after the Hamas attack of Oct. 7, and has tangled with U.S. officials over his hampering of humanitarian aid into Gaza and his stated desire to conduct a ground invasion in the crowded city of Rafah, which the United States thinks would lead to an unacceptably high level of civilian casualties. He’s also explicitly rejected U.S. entreaties to discuss a pathway to a two-state solution.

He failed to on Oct 7th. He’s continuing to fail now and making Israel even less safe than before the 7th with his forced starvation of civilians and wanton killing of women and children.

They should’ve been fighting in the tunnels. If you really just wanted Hamas you flush out those damn tunnels, collapse it as you push thru, and pick off guys as they resurface. Probably find hostages and destroy weapon caches that way too.  Take bomb sniffing robots and little drones down there if you’re worried about booby traps. That’s there entire support system and guess what, you would avoid all these massive civilian casualties. But they waste time recklessly bombing and bulldozing and shooting people scrambling for aid. Almost as if Hamas isn’t the target but Palestinian society as a whole is the target…?

2023-11-06 13:03:08,politics,Israel,17oyylt,k82avz7,Bernie Sanders says he hopes Israel rids of Netanyahu,"I think it's likely.  He's already in a power-sharing ""unity"" government with one of his rivals, and as Bernie says, his poll numbers are way down.

Not only was this a big fuck up by his government in getting caught by surprise, it's a result of Netanyahu's entire strategy around Hamas, as he [said](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-09/ty-article/.premium/another-concept-implodes-israel-cant-be-managed-by-a-criminal-defendant/0000018b-1382-d2fc-a59f-d39b5dbf0000):

> Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas

What happened was:

* Netanyahu was PM for 14 years, almost continuously, running on security as his main issue.  And the most recent government (before the unity government created after the attacks) was the most right wing in Israel's history.

* He is against a two state solution.  The main reason is not wanting to give up land/settlements on the West Bank.  Pumping up Hamas and undermining the Palestinian Authority keeps Palestinians divided, which undercuts any chance for a two state solution.  It also is a powerful argument against a Palestinian state - ""how can you ask us to leave the West Bank, look what happened when we left Gaza""

* He proceeded with normalization with Arab states without concessions (or with symbolic concessions) to the Palestinians, on the basis that the Palestinians can't interrupt that process (and the other Arab states don't love Hamas either, they wanna be respectable).

* Did other actions - more settlements, talk of annexing ""Area C"", embassy in Jerusalem, etc - that Israel/the US balked at on the basis of not wanting to piss the Palestinians off.

* Got closer to Russia, have a military industrial complex that does things like sell spyware to questionable foreign countries

* This was based on the idea that Hamas isn't *really* a big threat.  Israel has the blockade and the Iron Dome, they can (to use some buzzwords) ""shrink the conflict"" to the level of flare-ups every few years, Hamas fires some shitty rockets that don't kill anyone and Israel ""mows the grass"" in retaliation and cuts down Hamas's operational capabilities.  Enough to keep people scared, not enough to do real damage.

* Because the entire strategy is based on Hamas not being a big threat - you see what you want to see.

It's telling, by the way, that part of why Gaza was lightly defended was that troops were redeployed to the West Bank.  To defend settlers - in particular, the ""price tag"" extremists who are *looking for* a fight with Palestinians.  Microcosm of how Netanyahu was willing to trade off the danger of Hamas for territorial aggrandizement in the West Bank.",102,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/17oyylt/bernie_sanders_says_he_hopes_israel_rids_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/17oyylt/bernie_sanders_says_he_hopes_israel_rids_of/k82avz7

Maybe we should finally pass some kind of legislation or do something to undo the disastrous SCOTUS decision on Citizens United once and for all, so organizations like AIPAC can't dump an ungodly amount of money out to flood our elections and our airwaves with pro-Zionist propaganda.

Understand that AIPAC is not actually lobbying on behalf of Jewish people in either America or Israel. They are only trying to push through policy and candidates that will maintain and strengthen the *diplomatic and military* *relationship* between the two countries. They don't care what's actually happening over there. They don't care about calling for more effective Israeli leadership that has the best interests of the country in mind over leadership that seems dead set on dragging the country into a multi-pronged war.

They just want to make sure the U.S. and Israel stay connected at the hip. That's it. It's all about making the relationship so interdependent that we can't possibly question the Israeli leadership or its aims, because our interests have become so intertwined. AIPAC is literally trying to get the U.S. so attached to Israel that it can't extricate itself, no matter how poorly the country is behaving right now.

We don't need to be attached to any foreign country that deeply.

- Green Party candidate Jill Stein's running mate is Butch Ware, a history professor at UC Santa Barbara who focuses on ""race, religion and revolutionary thought.""   He also goes by Bilal Ware.    

- Apparently Ware's side gig is performing in a hip-hop group called ""Slum Prophecy.""   

- Slum Prophecy released an album in the summer of 2024 called ""Aqsa flood."" Which is a variation on Hamas' term for the October 7 attacks.

We still have a few weeks to hear sentencing, and he will undoubtedly appeal, which could last well into 2025.

But that's not what is important today.

This IS history. Polling saying voters are partisan and unmoved doesn't make it any less significant.

For starters, it's not a ""hush money"" case, as the media has latched onto. It's an *election interference* case, and these are *felonies.*

He worked to illegally cover up stories that could have easily swung the 2016 election, which was won by a few thousand votes in a few states, and could have altered the course of American history. It encapsulates everything about Trump and is the beginning to his criminal history saga regarding the Presidency.

It is hopefully only the beginning of his criminal accountability, and a necessary step forward for democracy, the rule of law, and us as a country.

That [law](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1071/pdf/COMPS-1071.pdf) says “no assistance shall be furnished” to any country that directly or indirectly restricts U.S. humanitarian assistance, an action the United Nations and numerous independent aid groups have accused Israel of carrying out repeatedly over the course of the 11-month [war in Gaza](https://www.washingtonpost.com/israel-hamas-war/?itid=lk_inline_manual_39).

>“The White House has made every excuse in the book for the behavior of the Israeli government when it comes to the obstruction of aid, and there is a degree of frustration that those decisions are being driven more by politics than by law,” said Jeremy Konyndyk, a former senior Biden administration official and now president of Refugees International.

>More significantly, the court said that states are under obligation “not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by Israel’s illegal presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.”   
>This is a problem for the U.S government, if it is to obey the directives of a court of which it is a founding member, by virtue of Washington’s ratification of the United Nations Charter. That’s because the United States is Israel’s largest aid provider, with over $20 billion in military aid provided in 2024, and more than that in arms sales authorizations.   
>As a result, such aid not only violates U.S. laws prohibiting arms to states that violate human rights, but a direct order from the ICJ. The U.S. Mission to the United Nation’s tweet this week stating that it will vote against a pending U.N. General Assembly resolution to enforce the advisory opinion is a pretty clear indication that the U.S. has no intention of complying with the ICJ.  
>The continued transfer of U.S. weapons to Israel may well become the source of charges against the U.S. government in the ICJ occupation case (as well as the separate case South Africa initiated concerning genocide claims against Israel), but also against individual U.S. officials in the ICC case, for aiding and abetting the crimes with which Israel is charged.

2024-05-09 21:38:13,politics,Israel,1co4b7g,l3cdj1l,Biden’s Rafah warning is turning point in US-Israel relations and a belated — but inevitable rupture — with Netanyahu ,"I mean, Regan withheld fighter aircraft from Israel in the 80s to get them to curb military operations. so its not exactly an original idea. it appears the weapons shipments that are being cut off may be limited to the sort of stuff that can take down buildings, not defensive weapons. I dont think anything has been made clear regarding smaller smart munitions, which rather twistedly probably will reduce civilian casualties so long as they keep getting shipped out.

its also unclear if the IDF operations are actually being well managed. The US and Iraqi army faced a similar situation in Iraq, and were able to efficiently (relatively speaking) check and move civilians out of an area they were going to attack. Its unclear if the IDF has even secured territory they've moved on from, which is a bit mind-boggling. 

regardless almost any decision is a no win for Biden, since either way hes pissing off needed voter demographics.

Biden alluded to a private conversation in which the Israeli leader said: ""'You carpet bombed Germany, you dropped the atom bomb, a lot of civilians died.'""

>Biden said he responded: ""Yeah, that's why all these institutions were set up after World War Two to see to it that it didn't happen again ... don't make the same mistakes we made in 9/11. There's no reason why we had to be in a war in Afghanistan.""  
...  
At the fundraiser, Biden specifically mentioned Israel's far-right politician Itamar Ben-Gvir, who is Israel's national security minister, and said ""this is the most conservative government in Israel's history.""

>Biden said Netanyahu must ""change,"" adding that ""this government in Israel is making it very difficult.""

>He also said that ultimately Israel ""can't say no"" to a Palestinian state, which Israeli hardliners oppose.

But the same people cut short their vacations and volunteered in huge numbers to serve in Gaza and on the Lebanon border after the attack, because we can feverishly argue between ourselves but when an existential threat is present - this is above politics.  


Bibi's government response to the people hurt in the attacks, the internally displaced people and the hostages was pretty bad, and now they're even back to giving away much needed funds to the ultra-orthodox. They don't even invest money into explaining Israel's actions to international media and to social media, while our adversaries have popular international news channels and botnets that spread propaganda.

That's it. Really. Israel's worth as a ""Holy Land"" steward is entirely dependent on the religiousness of US voters and said voters' ability to swing. It was and is still *overwhelming,* but has been in decline for decades. What's more, what's left of religion have been getting more extreme (and less swing,) we're starting to see Israel's worth erode. Also why we start seeing anti-*Israeli* protests manifest first and most commonly amongst higher education.

If not a ""Holy Land"" steward, Israel in reality sits in a geopolitically useless area of no interest to us. US strategic interests have been for decades in the Persian Gulf for oil and secondarily the Bosphorus to contain Russia.

Israel contributes nothing to either of these interests. It simply can't send its military anywhere since nobody likes it enough to ever give it access into, let alone through, their territory.

Until the muslim community doesn’t take charge of eliminating jihadist extremists we will never have peace because one side doesn’t want it. Look, I don’t want to see children die.

We have a chance to have a Democrat in the White House for 12 years. That's kinda important.

> The Big Lie is just that: a big lie. In America, if you lose, you accept the results. You follow the Constitution. You try again. You don’t call facts ‘fake’ and then try to bring down the American experiment just because you’re unhappy. That’s not statesmanship. That’s not statesmanship, that’s selfishness. That’s not democracy, it’s the denial of the right to vote. It suppresses. It subjugates. The denial of full and free and fair elections is the most un-American thing that any of us can imagine, the most undemocratic, the most unpatriotic, and yet, sadly, not unprecedented.
> 
> So hear me clearly: There is an unfolding assault taking place in America today—an attempt to suppress and subvert the right to vote in fair and free elections, an assault on democracy, an assault on liberty, an assault on who we are—who we are as Americans. For, make no mistake, bullies and merchants of fear and peddlers of lies are threatening the very foundation of our country. It gives me no pleasure to say this. I never thought in my entire career I’d ever have to say it. But I swore an oath to you, to God—to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. And that’s an oath that forms a sacred trust to defend America against all threats both foreign and domestic.

> The assault on free and fair elections is just such a threat, literally.

> I’ve said it before: We’re are facing the most significant test of our democracy since the Civil War. That’s not hyperbole. Since the Civil War.

My understanding is that the terms amount to Israel's demands, plus that the ceasefire only goes for 6 weeks.

Framing this as though the US and Israel have agreed while Hamas is holding it up is disingenuous when the terms are tantamount to surrender.  If you want your opponent to move, you must leave him a place to move to - isn't that when diplomacy works?

2024-10-05 20:22:47,politics,Israel,1fwy65a,lqieon7,Mark Kelly won’t back conditions on aid to Israel amid Lebanon escalation,"Because it's not Israel's escalation. It's Israel and the US's escalation. The IDF's approach to war in these area's - the so called [Dahiya Doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahiya_doctrine) isn't criticized because as a state department official once said about the Mujaheddin when they were fighting against the Soviets. ""They're Terrorists, but by god, they're our terrorists.""

What is dangerous here is that Mark Kelly, and others like Fetterman and apparently the Biden Administration, don't really realize that it's not necessarily in Israel's best interest to pursue conflict everywhere. There is a great book by Ze'ev Schiff (who was a correspondent at Haaretz for years), called [War of deception or Israel's Lebanon War](https://books.google.com/books/about/Israel_s_Lebanon_War.html?id=z99HgBsKp3sC) that covers the 1982 Israel/Lebanon conflict, we can trace a line from the false-pretenses used by Ariel Sharon for that conflict, and the consequences that came about (one of the chief being the creation of Hezbollah) and the current state of conflict Israel finds itself in.

Anyway when it's US-made planes, US provided bombs, US provided intelligence, US provided protection against international criticism/sanctions, US provided missile ships that defend against military repercussions, and US negotiating in bad-faith regarding cease-fires. At some point it's a US war.

A successful pivot requires complete attention and no distractions. The US has completely withdrawn from Afghanistan. It has been pushing for normalization of Saudi and Israel relationship for stability in the Middle East. 

Besides Israel’s war atrocities dragging American reputation into the mud worldwide, its escalation of conflicts with its neighbors will ignite a larger regional war. A war that will require US military support and attention. Attention it cannot spare in its long term goal to contain China.

2023-12-21 18:24:39,politics,Israel,18nsmh9,kecsxhf,John Fetterman blames TikTok for giving young people ‘warped’ view of Israel-Hamas war,"I really think that Starship Troopers should be required watching. It shows exactly how these extreme positions get entrenched through propaganda.

He should have just said social media, because had he said “boomers and Facebook” instead of “Young folks and Tik Tok,” the internet would agree with him. 


Facebook, Twitter/X, Tik Tok, Reddit, all of them have algorithms to keep you enraged and engaged. Social media destroys any nuance to a situation and folks have to make absolute stands on one side or the other or be attacked mercilessly for it.

There are more than two positions here and it’s vital we keep saying that so we don’t turn into monsters with perceived righteousness. 

I stand with innocent people who are dying in this senseless war. Doesn’t matter where they were born, what religion they are. Doesn’t matter if they are young or old. Doesn’t matter how affluent or poor they are. I care about those trapped and being used as physical and political shields and weapons in this war. I hate that people’s deaths are being used to confuse, enrage, and radicalise the general public. 

I care about making sure people aren’t exterminated for simply existing, which both sides are being pushed to believe and support. 

I do not stand with Hamas. I do not stand with Netanyahu and the actions of his government. I think both of them are exacerbating this war and uninterested in peace. I think they are both dangerous to the security of the globe.

I do not replace *Hamas* with *Palestinian* or *Netanyahu* with *Israel.*

And I don’t conflate Israel with Judaism. 

That is wrong and I won’t do it.

You can be critical of Netanyahu and the actions of his government and not be anti-Semitic. You can say Hamas needs to be removed from power forever and power base destroyed and not be Islamaphobic. 

There are very few good players in any of this right now and I refuse to be told that I *have* to support one of the insane position of propaganda that is being pushed to us. 

I think Nancy Pelosi said it best,

2024-04-03 00:51:29,politics,Israel,1bu8lc6,kxs9kb4,Israel faces outrage from Democrats over strike that killed aid workers,"Here’s a summary of the cycle of events based on previous experiences:

- Biden administration says it is outraged and that it will talk to the Netanyahu administration.

- Israel officials will say that it was a mistake (even through it was 3 separate aid trucks in different regions of the de-militarized area and sure does look like a precision strike).

- Israel will say that there were targets in the area and somehow will justify the strikes.

- about 6 months will pass and they Israel administration will admit that no credible targets were in the area and it was an on purpose strike while at the same time attempting to justify striking clearly marked aid vehicles.

- no consequences will be placed on the Israeli administration and they will move on to the next atrocity. Rinse & repeat.

We saw this with the strikes to the Al Jezeera building, the hospitals, the aid stations, the flower massacre, the murder of journalists (American or otherwise).

Death lurks around every corner for Palestinians, whether from Israeli airstrike, gunshot, or tank; illness caused by Israel’s destruction of sanitation; or, pressingly, starvation, as Israel plunges Palestinians in Gaza into the worst famine in modern history, with 1.1 million at risk of or currently experiencing famine.

I think the Biden administration should have taken a tougher stance on aid to Gaza months ago.

The point when they were considering building the temporary pier should definitely have been a wake-up call for them.

Even now, Israel claims to be increasing humanitarian aid, but [the UN is challenging the figures](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/04/1148656).

There is no legitimate reason to oppose aid to Ukraine. It is not a matter of supporting only one of the two, between Ukraine and Israel. 

We can easily afford supporting both. What's more, supporting Ukraine is *extremely* relevant to our geopolitical situation. In exactly the same way that Israel is a strategic location for the US to have a military presence in the Middle East, Ukraine provides a massive potential opportunity to establish a strong Democracy with close ties to the US and membership in NATO.

""By providing the weapons being used to deliberately kill journalists, you are complicit in one of the gravest affronts to press freedom today,"" wrote a coalition of reporters, news outlets, and press freedom groups.

\[...\] An arms embargo against Israel has the support of a majority of the U.S. public as well as United Nations experts and leading human rights organizations.

The new letter spotlights the devastating toll Israel's assault has taken on Palestinian journalists, 109 of whom have been killed since October 7, according to the latest tally from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). \[...\]

Targeting journalists is a war crime under international law.

""Journalism is not a crime, and must never be a death sentence,"" Ackerman said Thursday. ""When Russia kills and imprisons journalists, the U.S. is appropriately vocal in condemnation, but when Israel does it, the U.S. falls silent. Yet every Palestinian, Lebanese, American—remember Shireen Abu Akleh—and other journalist that Israel has killed implicates its patron, the United States, which possesses the leverage to stop Israel's onslaught.""

The press freedom coalition wrote to Blinken on Thursday that ""the U.S. is providing the weapons Israel continually uses to target Palestinian journalists in Gaza.""

""This is a violation of international law and U.S. domestic law,"" the letter continues. ""We urge you to immediately cease the transfer of all weapons to Israel.""

And I'm not saying that because I'm against it or anything. I'm very pro-Palestinian, pro-ceasefire, and want to see Israel held responsible for their horrendous actions. I'm saying it because the American public, by-and-large, do not care. They're not single-issue I/P voters. The Marquette poll that came out last night had I/P voters at 2%. That's within the MoE of zero. The economy was at 38%, for comparison. American voters care about what will personally impact them, not about what is happening across the ocean.

It's not going to hurt her in any way, not even in Michigan, for telling off protestors. The only people who think it will are terminally-online people who've made that catastrophe the single most important thing in their minds and live in a bubble.

2024-10-31 03:42:18,politics,Israel,1gg5jdf,lun5ylh,How can I vote for Kamala Harris if she supports Israel’s war? Here is my answer,"Here's my answer.

These ""protest votes"" against Harris are a tad unnerving considering the alternative.

In regards to the conflict in Israel, Harris has been vocal about a cease fire, she's openly expressed sympathy for innocent civilians in Gaza, she even refused to show up for Netanyahu's performance in Congress recently, performance being the key word there.

Donald Trump however, has an entirely different record as president, one that we can point to, and one that illustrates his own self-serving agenda and hardline stance on the war in Gaza. 

Trump cozied up to Netanyahu, and like he has with several contentious world leaders, Trump caved in to Bibi's political pressures.

Let me preface this by saying, I'm an American Jew myself, with Ashkenazi heritage no less, but I've spent time trying to understand this conflict and its complicated history from multiple historical perspectives. 

I don't take an indiscriminate stance on this war, my views are more nuanced, so I understand that not all Palestinians, nor are all Israelis a monolith. I understand that this conflict didn't begin on October 7th. I can sympathize with Palestinians who have suffered under military occupation, from collective punishment and the dispossession of their land. I can also sympathize with the plight of Jews who suffered from violent pogroms and almost lost their ethnic and national identity as a result of the Jewish diaspora.

I also understand that the two have been engaged in a cycle of violent conflict over land since the end of WWI after the signing of the Balfour Declaration. Some historians might argue it stretches back to the late nineteenth century as ""Zionism out of despair"" became a fledgling movement. Some argue that this conflict began in the mid-20th century, but that ignores decades of history leading up to that moment in time. 

Nevertheless, I can condemn both Hamas (and adjacent terror groups) and Netanyahu as it relates to the current state of the conflict in the region. Netanyahu has made it clear that a two state solution is no solution at all, while Hamas and its allies have also been unrelenting and undeniably share the blame in perpetuating this decades-long bloody conflict. A stalemate that has cost countless lives.

That being said, Trump's record indicates that not only is he willing to take an indiscriminate stance on this war that he likely knows next to nothing about, but he's willing to do it merely because he thinks its what's best for him politically.

Believe it or not, Trump is responsible for escalating multiple conflicts in the Middle East, some of which the U.S. military was involved. 

When it comes to his staunch Pro Israel record as president, Trump acknowledged Israel's controversial annexation of Golan Heights, and in December of 2017, formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and stated that the American embassy would be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

This act alone only heightened tensions in the region and weakened the U.S.'s capacity to act as a peace negotiator between Palestinians and Israelis. Such a move was a capitulation to Israeli leaders. While Trump, or more likely his advisors, understood the move was one that would garner them more support from their Christian voters who only see Jews as a means to a biblical end, quite literally mind you.

What's more, Trump's ""Middle East peace plan"" was poorly contrived, amateurish, and a step *away* from peace in the region. In fact, as foreign policy goes, it was more political theater than anything else as it also happened to coincide with his re-election campaign. This plan in particular also weakened our position as peace brokers in the region.

It's also important to note, that Donald Trump, by his very nature, doesn't have any specific foreign policy or political philosophy. His only philosophy is ""what's best for me?""

So his rhetoric can change at any moment depending on what's best for his political career. It should also be noted, that his rhetoric shifted temporarily after Netanyahu acknowledged Biden's win in 2020. Trump's penchant for holding grudges and his vindictive nature can also sometimes alter his public mood or his rhetoric. He's like a child really.

But that hasn't stopped him from labeling all pro Palestinian protestors as ""radicals.""

Speaking directly to the pro Palestinian movement, Trump reportedly said,

> “Well, if you get me elected, and you should really be doing this, if you get me reelected, we’re going to set that movement back 25 or 30 years,”

Trump may have offhandedly criticized Israel once or twice during this conflict, but he's quickly backpedaled with statements like, they ""have to have a victory.""

Because Trump also sees everything through a ratings lens, he's tastelessly claimed that Israel is ""absolutely losing the PR war.""

Trump hasn't laid out a plan for addressing the war in Israel if he wins a second term. But Trump's son-in-law and former nepokid, Middle East adviser, Jared Kushner, recently suggested that Gaza’s current borders can be redrawn in direct contradiction with current U.S. policy.

> “Gaza’s waterfront property could be very valuable,” Kushner said

It's likely that Trump's advisors have cautioned him against speaking out about the war, but that hasn't kept him from stigmatizing Palestinians and pro Palestinian protestors.

Also keep in mind Trump's history of bigoted remarks and actions taken against Muslims/the Arab world.

Before his presidency, Trump suggested multiple times that the U.S. has a ""Muslim problem."" He even called for the surveillance of Muslims and Muslim communities.

In 2015, he said he will ""look at"" closing mosques.

He defended warantless searches of American Muslims.

Trump once said he would “certainly implement” a database system to track Muslims and encouraged a Muslim registry

He called for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S.""

He's called Muslims ""sick people.""

Trump appointed Steve Bannon as his chief strategist. Bannon once claimed that “the Judeo-Christian west” is engaged in a “global war” against “jihadist Islamic fascism.”

Then there's Trump's first ""Muslim ban"", an executive order banning Syrian refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries.

Trump issued multiple iterations of his Muslim ban after that, including one that barred foreign nationals from eight countries.

Throughout his presidency, Trump reiterated the need for a Muslim ban and extreme vetting process and claimed that crime spikes were the result of ""radical islamic terror.""

While on Twitter, Trump also retweeted posts from an anti-muslim hate group.

And to add to this, let's not forget the recent ""rally"" in MSG that included a long list of speakers spouting extreme, xenophobic rhetoric.

All that being said, what I'm getting at here is, based on both of their records, who do you think is more likely to provide Palestinians with a greater measure of support and acknowledgement as president?",31,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1gg5jdf/how_can_i_vote_for_kamala_harris_if_she_supports/,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1gg5jdf/how_can_i_vote_for_kamala_harris_if_she_supports/lun5ylh

Here is my answer,"“Prior to the war, the U.S.-Israel relationship had suffered some strains over the rhetoric and policies of Netanyahu’s government, including its plans to curb the Israeli Supreme Court’s powers and its approval of more Jewish settlements in the West Bank—critics say the settlements violate international law and undermine prospects for a future state for Palestinians. The so-called two-state solution has been a long-running U.S. foreign policy goal, including for the Biden administration. Some U.S. lawmakers have raised these criticisms in the debate over U.S. aid to Israel during the war in Gaza.”

I don’t think people understand what it means to walk up to our friends who have lost many loved ones in this war and tell them “don’t you understand, it can actually be worse?”. Have a fucking heart. What’s worse than them being killed indiscriminately and forcibly moved from their homes that they can’t return to? Nuking the place? Nuke it already then. You think they care if their death is slow or fast? Accelerate? Are you all serious? And even locally - you think the dems really have shown that they would protect us?

You want to bring the Arab vote, then just acknowledge that the dems can do better - you don’t have to say Trump will be worse. All people have to do is say - we are stuck in a shitty position because the Middle East is a fucked up place and our end goal is to stop this war (and yes that is different rhetoric than what is currently being said , which heavily implies the status quo is continuing). 

Arabs have felt betrayed by the democrats have been marginalised over and over again - shushed, educated on how “Trump is bad for us”, representatives who have said nothing walked out of rallies where fucking Liz Cheney was honoured (in the only state where the Arab vote matters). 

The dems have made it clear that they don’t give a crap about the Arab vote. Okay. So why all this drama? You either care and cater to the market you want or Let them be. Go pick up the voters republicans shat out of their party, the likes  of Liz Cheney instead who are apparently more worth your time.

And all this said - I’m somehow probably voting for Harris in the end. because Trump is a terrible human being and only because I’m sick of people excusing everything they do by saying well Trump will be worse.

Those voters should realize that if you're protesting Biden on an issue that you're mind can't be changed on, then what does Biden have to gain by doing what you want since he's apparently already lost your vote for good?

Biden should've been tougher with Israel from the jump, but he is listening and improving. Trump is LITTERALLY encouraging Israel to implement a final solution on the Palestinians.

When conflict shoved them out of their homes, many of Dearborn’s parents fled to Michigan in pursuit of the American dream and the promise that their voices would be heard and valued. Today, we instill in our children the American aspiration of standing on the side of justice for all people, everywhere,” he said.

Maybe their friends and families back in palestine can stop supporting and electing people who literally state they want to kill jews wherever they find them? That might be a good start too. I wonder what the stance of Mayor Abdullah Hammoud (D) of Dearborn, Mich., is on that..Does he offer a solution for the Middle East, from his perch as the mayor of Dearborn? If so, I am open to it. I would love to hear it. I only see  temporary holds offered. I see what hamas thinks is a solution. I see what Isreal thinks is a solution. I wonder what the Dearborn mayors solution is. Stop selling weapons to Isreal. Poof, done..now what? did the palestinian people suddenly decide they are going to live in peace now or would something else happen? I just never see concrete things offered other than ""the jews""(now updated to zionists, to help the denialism) be removed to somewhere, someplace, somehow..if we remove all the places Hamas and by extension its population has stated is acceptable, where does that leave?

2024-03-26 16:38:08,politics,Israel,1bocbmf,kwnwkhn,Top U.S. Progressive: It’s time to separate Ukraine and Israel aid,"From the [Semafor Principals](https://www.semafor.com/newsletter/03/26/2024/break-it-up?utm_campaign=semaforreddit) newsletter:

While tensions between Bibi and the White House flare, Capitol Hill progressives are making the case for breaking up Israel and Ukraine aid, Semafor’s Kadia Goba reports.

In a new video set to be released this week, Rep. Jamaal Bowman says he’s opposed to the Senate’s $95 billion foreign aid bill, which combines support for the two countries, due to Israel’s conduct in Gaza.

“We cannot stand by and allow children to be bombed, to die of starvation, or to see their entire families wiped out,” he says, according to a partial transcript shared with Semafor. “That is why I cannot support the Senate’s aid bill, and why we need a standalone vote on Ukraine funding.”

Bowman isn’t alone. In recent weeks a progressive limelights including Reps. Pramila Jayapal, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Summer Lee have suggested they would not join a discharge petition to force a vote on the Senate bill, which is currently stalled in the House, over their concerns about Israel.

“I keep saying to the administration, give us a standalone on Ukraine,” Rep. Delia Ramirez, Ill., told Semafor last week.

Democrats have generally resisted the idea of separating the aid packages, which Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has floated repeatedly. But there is now clearly a left-right coalition that favors it.
