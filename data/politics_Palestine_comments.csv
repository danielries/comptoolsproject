I’m an anti-genocide leftist, myself. I loathe that the Democratic Party is signaling their willingness to continue to arm Israel. 

I’m still voting for Harris. 

I’m voting for Harris because she *might* be persuaded to withdraw support from Israel, or do more to safeguard Palestinians. Trump won’t be. Netanyahu will tell him he’s pretty and trump will be throwing rocks at Gaza himself. 

I’m voting for Harris because her economic plans will benefit all of us. 

I’m voting for Harris because, as a woman, I’m not ready to become a 2nd class citizen 

I’m voting for Harris because I’d like to continue to VOTE in free, fair elections 

I’m voting for Harris because the Supreme Court and Federal Courts are stuffed with trump appointees.

Nancy Pelosi suggested that Russia may be funding pro-Palestinian protesters who have been interrupting Democratic campaign events, saying that some calling for a ceasefire are promoting “Putin’s message.”

Protesters disrupted Pelosi’s appearance in Seattle on Thursday to call for an end to Israel‘s assault on Palestine. Vocal demonstrators have also been appearing regularly at President Joe Biden’s events. Pelosi said that she would like the FBI to investigate whether Russia is financing these groups.

Other countries, including Israel spend billions as well. Almost all of that money goes to private American companies with military contracts. Neither party is going to risk upsetting that machine. No one is going to take a stand and risk alienating the most powerful group of corporations in the American system.

Edit: Adding a couple things since this comment blew up. First, if you care about Palestine, when the alternative is Donald Trump, Biden is clearly the candidate better equipped to stop the violence. Not voting makes you part of the problem. 

Second, while I acknowledge Tik Tok has lots of issues (Reddit does too), it’s still probably the #1 platform to reach Gen Z. The Biden campaign desperately needs to win them back  not just for votes but for building a long-term coalition of leftist voters.

Third, all these “Gen Z is stupid” or “Zoomers are brainless” comments are unhelpful. Let’s not forget they voted for Biden at a higher margin than any generation in 2020. In 2022, they voted at a higher percentage than Millennials or Gen X for their first midterm election. They are young and figuring things out and just trying to fit in.

2024-01-31 21:04:53,politics,Palestine,1afsmys,koc66a5,US ‘could recognise Palestine’ after war in Gaza,"**From The Telegraph:**

The United States could recognise a Palestinian state after the war in Gaza, according to reports suggesting the State Department is considering a shift in policy.

Antony Blinken, America’s top diplomat, has commissioned the State Department to review potential options for US and international recognition of a Palestinian state, Axios reported.

It comes after Lord Cameron revealed that Britain is weighing up whether to formally recognise Palestine as a state.

The Foreign Secretary said Britain had a “responsibility” to work towards a two-state solution, adding: “We with allies will look at the issue of recognising a Palestinian state, including at the United Nations.”

Matt Miller, a spokesman for the State Department, said the Biden administration has not shifted its policy on the issue, but declined to comment on reports of a review.

“We have been quite clear publicly that we support the establishment of an independent Palestinian state … with security guarantees for Israel,” he said. “That’s been the policy of the United States for some time.”

However, he continued: “We look at any number of options. That’s part of the normal planning process. The vast majority of options never usually get implemented.”

Washington has opposed recognition of a Palestinian state for decades, arguing that it should only be achieved through negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.

But a senior official told Axios that the administration’s push to find a diplomatic way out of Israel’s war in Gaza has required a re-examination of “old US paradigms and policies”.

The move towards normalising ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia is seen by the White House as a pathway to recognition of a Palestinian state, according to Axios.

2024-07-23 17:03:39,politics,Palestine,1eacwju,lekkm3y,I worked to elect Kamala Harris. She must break with Biden on Israel and Palestine,">[I resigned because of Joe Biden’s disastrous policy on Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza), providing the financial and diplomatic support for the Israeli military to massacre, starve and forcibly expel countless Palestinians in Gaza. As a staffer in the administration, I heard reports that Harris and her staff pushed the US president to adopt a policy on Gaza that was both more humane and in alignment with international law, but were rebuffed. I saw the Harris I moved to Iowa for in her speech in Selma, becoming the first senior administration official calling for a ceasefire, even as I was disappointed that it was only for six weeks. This was reportedly an effort by Biden’s team to water down her speech. It is shameful that Biden refused to listen to Harris – or the majority of Americans for that matter. Now that Biden has stepped aside, she has the opportunity to chart her own path on Israel and Palestine.
>
>
>
>For months, the majority of Democrats and Americans, including American Jews, have supported a lasting ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. Harris must make clear that she supports using the US government’s leverage to end the bloodshed and reunite families. One clear way that she can do so is by supporting an arms embargo on offensive weapons for the Israeli military – a policy floated by Biden before he ultimately backtracked and greenlit Israel’s devastating ground invasion of Rafah.
>
>
>
>Once Israel’s brutal assault on Gaza ends, a President Harris could begin a new era in which the US government uses commonsense diplomatic and financial pressure to bring about a long-term political solution that would end Israel’s system of apartheid over Palestinians and guarantee equality, justice and safety for Palestinians and Israelis alike.
>
>
>
>By setting herself apart from Biden’s failed policy, Harris has the opportunity to rebuild a coalition to defeat Trump that would include progressives, young people and Arab Americans among others.
>
>
>
>More than 700,000 Democrats voted uncommitted during the primary in protest of Biden’s support for Israel’s war on Gaza. They are a crucial part of the coalition needed for Democrats to win swing states like Michigan, Georgia and Minnesota. The policies these voters are demanding are broadly popular among Democrats and Americans writ large. [Even a majority of my own community, American Jews, support conditioning arms shipments to Israel](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/article-804548).
>
>
>
>Harris must initiate a new era in American policy towards Israel, not just because it is the right thing to do, but because it is both the popular and the politically savvy popular thing to do. What better way to draw attention to the authoritarianism of Trump than for Harris to resoundly reject all authoritarianism abroad?
>
>
>
>Harris has at times fallen short of her promise to deliver justice. As a prosecutor, she put nonviolent drug users behind bars and she prosecuted parents for their children’s absence from school. She has also maintained close ties with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), the rightwing lobby primarily funded by Republican donors that has endorsed election-deniers and anti-abortion extremists. If Harris is serious about “putting justice on the ballot”, she must commit to ending mass incarceration and overzealous prosecution in this country and reject Aipac’s rightwing agenda as president. If she does both, she has the opportunity to turn out record numbers of voters to enable her to defeat Trump in November.

The plan also suggests using RICO statutes, typically used against organized crime, to help prosecute leading pro-Palestine organizations.

Project Esther outlines a series of steps: going after “propaganda” in schools, pursuing intimidation tactics to stop students from joining demonstrations, and restricting communication, coordination, and meetings between pro-Palestinian groups. The plan envisions a point at which most of the Jewish community and the general public perceive pro-Palestine groups “as a threat to their safety.” The whole process would be successful “within 12 to 24 months,” according to the plan.""

This is the plan if Trump wins. So clearly he's not going to help in this war. And he's going to try to jail and deport anyone who is in support of the Palestinian people.

2024-10-22 00:30:45,politics,Palestine,1g923v0,lt3icd3,Project Esther: Next chapter of Project 2025 plans destruction of Palestine solidarity movement,"> Project 2025 has a new chapter: Project Esther. Unveiled by the ultra-right Heritage Foundation on the one-year anniversary of Israel launching its genocidal campaign against the people of Gaza, Project Esther claims to present a “national strategy to combat antisemitism.”

> The document claims that anti-Zionism and pro-peace sentiments are always and in every case equivalent to antisemitism. It calls for infiltrating, surveilling, and destroying groups it identifies as being affiliated with an alleged “global Hamas support network.”

> Targeted organizations include, but are not limited to: Students for Justice in Palestine, American Muslims for Palestine, Jewish Voice for Peace, Alliance for Global Justice, the Tides Foundation, and even the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. It bizarrely alleges that these groups’ motivations and understanding of history come “straight from the pages” of the Communist Manifesto.

> Neither the Klan nor neo-Nazis are identified as possible targets in the project outline, as if antisemitism does not exist among the network of white supremacist organizations that support MAGA.

And what about the rest of us that think zionists are full of shit but aren't part of some group other than the voting public? Most of us are not deportable. It's not about Jews. It's about Bibi and his genocide. I don't give a fuck what your burning shrub of a god told you, you can't just go around murdering people and taking their shit. And that includes us.

He said on Oct. 11 that a future Trump administration would “fully support Israel defeating, dismantling, and permanently destroying the terrorist group Hamas,” while telling the Republican Jewish Coalition later that month that Hamas fighters “will burn forever in the eternal pit of hell."" That month, his campaign also said that, if elected again, he would bar Gaza residents from entering the U.S. as part of an expanded travel ban.""

Opinion/ ???: ""Permanently destroying Hamas"" means attacking them wherever they hide. Does he realize that's why Gazans are dying? Does he understand if HAMAS falls, Hezbollah will take over their efforts and do so from Lebanon and Iran?  This is very similar to the USA trying to root out ISIS in Iraq and ended up fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan!",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1g923v0/project_esther_next_chapter_of_project_2025_plans/,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1g923v0/project_esther_next_chapter_of_project_2025_plans/ltayx5l

I know, blah blah rural voters would have less power. Which is a good thing, because they are less people. We don't weight ethnic, religious, or sexual minority voters more to protect their rights. That is what a Bill of Rights is for. This is a nonsense argument.

This dynamic is antidemocratic on its own terms and obviously dripping with arrogance from party elites, but it also has now sunk the party. Virtually nobody of consequence within the party felt comfortable speaking out against Biden running again. Through the party's behind the scenes maneuvering to neutralize any real primary challengers, voters were stripped of the opportunity to give voice to what polls made clear, which is that Democratic voters across the country preferred he not run again.

Progressives, activists, and other voters across the Dem party have every right to feel we've been betrayed, silenced, and treated like babies by the party machine. Perhaps all along it was rank and file voters who were smarter than Biden's inner circle. It was us who recognized Biden's old age and cognitive deficiencies made him unfit to serve into his mid-80's. It was his team that stubbornly pushed forward while going to great lengths to hide him from the public.

Everyone involved in the Dem party machine should be ashamed. While they are all wealthy enough to live prosperously during and after Trump's 2nd term, I hope their knowledge that their legacies are forever tarnished eats at them for the remainder of their lives. It is unconscionable what they've done, purely out of their own arrogance and distrust of the very Americans they claim to work on behalf of.",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1dvzgdy/propalestine_democrats_were_here_already_its_not/,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1dvzgdy/propalestine_democrats_were_here_already_its_not/lbr16bb

“Biden Campaign” => immediately losing a bunch of the audience

“Slams” => just stop

“Parroted Hitler” is good because it’s correct. It can stay. But this orange clown is a straight up, mask off fascist right now. Moreso than before. He was still learning to be a fascist in 2016. He ran into a whole bunch of unexpected checks and balances in his administration (possibly because he’s learning from a world leader that doesn’t HAVE any checks and balances). So now he wants to do away with those.

He wants to put me in a camp. And I’m just some guy. I donno if he’d be able to do it if he got a second term, but I know he’d try to work his way there.

He wants to put you in a camp too.

No more politics as sports. This is not helpful at all. Situation critical, because the American people are going to forget about how bad it was before if it’s treated as normal. And things will be worse if he gets in again.

Also? If he gets in again? That won’t be his last term. Guaranteed.

But over 9 million homes, schools, daycares, and businesses receive their water through a lead pipe, putting people at risk of lead exposure. Lead is a neurotoxin that can irreversibly harm brain development in children, and it can also accumulate in the bones and teeth, damage the kidneys, and interfere with the production of red blood cells needed to carry oxygen. Due to decades of inequitable infrastructure development and underinvestment, lead poisoning disproportionately affects low-income communities and communities of color. There is no safe level of exposure to lead. That is why the President made a **commitment to replace every lead pipe in the country within a decade** and coordinated a whole of government effort to deploy resources and leverage every tool across federal, state and local government to address lead hazards through the Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan. 

>As part of this unprecedented commitment, President Biden is traveling today to Wilmington, North Carolina, to announce **$3 billion through his Investing in America agenda to replace toxic lead pipes.** This investment, administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is part of the historic $15 billion in dedicated funding for lead pipe replacement provided by the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Today’s announcement delivers funding to every state and U.S. territory to help address lead in drinking water while creating good-paying jobs, many of them union jobs. In addition, this program funding is part of the President’s Justice40 Initiative, which set a goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities, and is helping address the inequities of lead exposure.

>Additionally, to further reduce lead exposure, **the Department of Housing and Urban Development is announcing today nearly $90 million** in available funding to reduce residential health hazards in public housing, including lead-based paint hazards, carbon monoxide, mold, radon, fire safety, and asbestos, advancing the President’s Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan.

>Today’s announcement from the EPA builds on more than $20 billion in water infrastructure investments that state and local governments have made through the President’s American Rescue Plan. North Carolina has invested close to $2 billion from the American Rescue Plan in more than 800 clean water, wastewater, and stormwater projects across the state and is using another $150 million to test for and remove lead hazards in every school and child care center across the state, a historic effort to remove lead from North Carolina schools.

2023-12-15 00:44:54,politics,Palestine,18imr4x,kdecrfb,Elizabeth Warren is demanding more transparency from Meta on how it's handling content about Palestine on Instagram,"I’d say social media providing a decent amount of content on the conditions in Gaza. 

This is reflected by the fact I don’t recall anybody discussing the over 100k dead civilians as a result of ethnic cleansing in the Tigray war (2020-2022). Or the mass sexual violence that was perpetrated in the war against women with mass rapes and torture/

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigray_War

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mai_Kadra_massacre

Also don’t recall seeing this much outrage when by comparison more civilians died in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol alone when Russia flattened it during their invasion as opposed to what is going on in Gaza. Not to mention the mass killings in other cities as use of sexual violence against the Ukrainian population as a terror weapon. 

Unfortunately, that didn’t stop The Squad from objecting to aid to Ukraine. 

Personally, the social media would reflect the fact the recent carnage occurred not as a result of tensions spilling over between Palestinians and Israel but instead the intent of the 10/07 attack was to drive a wedge between the Arab States and Israel since this is a strategic threat to Iran and which is further evidenced that Irans other proxies such as Hezbollah and the Houthi rebels start attack northern Israel and international shipping in the Red Sea at the same time Hamas started their attack. POTUS has indicated as much when this started.

2024-01-16 13:36:33,politics,Palestine,19831j6,ki4dgj8,Bernie Sanders to force vote on Israel’s human rights practices in Gaza,"Senators on Tuesday will vote on whether to require the Biden administration to look into potential human rights abuses perpetrated by Israel in its military campaign in Gaza.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), an independent who caucuses with Democrats, is forcing the politically tricky vote using a mechanism in U.S. foreign assistance law that requires the State Department to look into human rights practices of nations receiving U.S. aid. If passed, the resolution would require the department to produce a report within 30 days about any potential abuses and how U.S. weapons have been used in Gaza.

The resolution would not alter U.S. aid to Israel, but it is still facing opposition from the Biden administration and many Democrats, who have raised concerns about the message the vote would send.

“We are trying to call attention to some unpleasant realities that I think a lot of people would prefer not to deal with,” Sanders said in an interview.

Per the 2020 census, Enid OK has a population just north of 51,000. 

I’m confused how the six wards of the city are apportioned if the ward participating in the recall only has ~ 5,600 registered voters.

Since then, humanitarian aid to Gaza has increased substantially, and Biden advisers credit Israel with responding to the president’s demands, though U.S. officials acknowledge that the aid is still not as much as is needed.

>Israel has withdrawn some of its forces from southern Gaza but is still planning a major assault on the southern city of Rafah, where about one million Palestinians have taken refuge. Biden administration officials have expressed concerns about the plans, and Israeli officials have said they would take that feedback into consideration and consult further with American counterparts.

>Under the U.S.-sponsored cease-fire proposal, Israel would halt hostilities for six weeks and release hundreds of Palestinians held in its prisons in exchange for the release of 40 hostages held by Hamas, mainly women, older men and those with health conditions.

2024-04-15 15:57:13,politics,Palestine,1c4melc,kzp141c,A Test of Strength: Biden stands with America’s allies. Trump doesn’t.,"What a sack of GARBAGE this sociopathic, horrific article is.  From one of the preeminent neocons, David Frum.  The fact that he is a Biden cheerleader is not the win Democrats think it is.  It shows the absolute degradation of the Democratic Party and how comically far Right the Overton Window is.

First, Israel struck Iran.  ""Israel should count score and strike back against Iran when the time is right"" is absolute nonsense.  Israel is the aggressor, and Iran has been the MORE reasonable party throughout all of this.  More reasonable than Israel OR Joe Biden.  Donald Trump tore up the Iran Deal because he hated everything Obama did.  What is Biden's excuse for not getting back into that deal 3 years later?  There isn't one.  Pure 1990's-era Zionist lunacy and pure stubbornness.

It is actively a terrible, terrible thing that we are helping fund our ""ally"" Israel as they starve and massacre innocent people as collective punishment for an attack that their general brutal treatment of Gazans had specifically propelled.  The fact that they ALSO want a world war--want to start one that US dollars and troops will have to fight--should immediately mean that we stop all funding to these rogue ungrateful f\*cking psychopaths, not that we leap into rebuilding their forces so that they can go and attack Iran again.  So that they can go and shoot sobbing people who are looking for their dead children's remains in the rubble in Gaza.

Frum has wanted a regional Middle East war for decades.  He has never ever cared about how many people will die, how close we could be to nuclear conflict, or how many trillions of dollars we throw into various holes in the world so we can protect corporate oil and defense interests.  Him championing the Great Work of Joe Biden for continuing to fund war crimes and catastrophic offensive provocations is almost literally sickening.  And, BTW, those war crimes will also likely cost Biden the slim chance he still has to be reelected.  So imagine a World War AND Trump, while you're smiling about how David Frum ""nailed Republicans"" for being obstructionist.

I don't care how many times Trump repeats his lies, or how often rightwing sources try to downplay events, or family that I can no longer have a relationship with tell me I'm brainwashed by some agenda, or friends that just laugh, shrug their shoulders and claim not to be too concerned with ""politics"" since 2021.

2024-04-03 14:51:07,politics,Palestine,1butlwh,kxuzond,Palestinian American doctor walks out of Biden meeting in protest,"**Palestinian-American believe, wrongly, that America has control over Israel. Nothing could be further from the truth.**

America does have an interest in the region, mainly to prevent the place blowing up in a huge war and, possibly, in a nuclear war.

Only idiots ignore that Israel has nuclear weapons, despite America's and Europe's best efforts to prevent Israel from developing those weapons. Israel does not admit it has those weapons but we all know it does.

**Many countries have vowed to destroy Israel**

But what most people don't know is that Israel has a doom's day policy that if it ever gets invaded or is nearing destruction, it will obliterate most of the Middle East in a nuclear firestorm. That policy is called the [Samson Option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Option).

America's interest in the region is simple; peace at all cost in order to create political stability necessary for commerce in the most oil rich area on Earth.

Also, America's interest in Israel is that it wants to prevent Israel from selling nuclear weapons technology to other countries that might eventually become hostile towards the US. 

Lastly, America wants to avoid a nuclear exchange where Israel would, in self-defense, destroy much of the Middle East.

Those are why America is supporting Israel, for stability, to prevent a proliferation of nuclear weapons through the world and to avoid a nuclear war.

**Why America sells weapons to Israel?**

Because if America doesn't, the French, the Chinese or the Russians will or Israel will make its own weapons, just like Israel copied the French Mirage to produce the [Kfir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAI_Kfir) or copied the F-16 to make the [Lavi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAI_Lavi). Israel also makes its own tanks, the [Merkava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkava) and its own missile systems.

**Why America supports Israel?**

Because having America threaten all the countries that would like to destroy Israel is the best way to avoid a nuclear conflict in the region, knowing that Israel's dooms day policy is to launch all of its nukes on the capital cities of its enemies.

**Basically that's the deal, either America ensures Israel's security or Israel gets invaded/destroyed and the whole Middle East becomes a radioactive wasteland.**

The actions of America are actually saving Arab lives.

**The worst thing that could happen to the Middle East is America deciding it no longer cares, remove its protection from Israel and allowing a war to start and possibly Israel launching nukes in desperation.**",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1butlwh/palestinian_american_doctor_walks_out_of_biden/,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1butlwh/palestinian_american_doctor_walks_out_of_biden/kxuzond

It was a really phenomenal address and we should be doing more to talk about the content and the significance here. Biden is only the second sitting President invited to give the commencement at Morehouse, with the first being Obama in '13. He got big applause for his administration's support of how important HBCUs are through both words and funding. 

It's also important to note that he is still publicly calling for a ceasefire and a 2 state solution in Gaza. To hear the press state it, you wouldn't believe he stands for either thing. 

It's pretty staggering how hard it was to find an article that doesn't still cast this commencement as something that was going to be a big mistake, when it was a phenomenal address to the Morehouse Men and ended with him being conferred an honorary doctorate of law.

The reality is that this should have been ironed out BEFORE creating the nation of Israel. Because of that failure, we have a big fucking mess that can't and won't ever end without some level of diaspora.

We're so far into the thousands that 100 here or there are inconsequential, half a percent of the total, half a day's casualties.   

For every one of those 100, 240 people have died, 600 have been injured, and 3000 homes have been destroyed.  Who's life is worth 240 people dying for?

For every Israeli that died on 10/7 20 Palestinians have been killed since  If we add the 100 hostages to the number of  Israel dead, we'll only have to wait 5 days for the ratio to get back up to 20:1, which is double the historic rate of 10:1 in prior years, which lead to 10/7.

Supporting what can reasonably be called a genocide with a statement like this puts our country at risk of terrorist attack.  

Killing 1% of a population isn't a way to ensure that they won't want to kill you in the future.   It didn't work in '48, '67, '87, '00, '14 etc.  

They might root out Hamas, but the next generation isn't going to think differently after suffering this trauma.  It's not like when the PLO left, their replacement was much better.   The situation was the same, only the names change.

Israel doesn't need a statement of support, we already sent them $130 Billion.   They need a different approach.  Whether or not they take it is on them, but US can no longer be complicit in their crimes, hostages or not.",-5,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1977jdc/statement_from_president_joe_biden_marking_100/,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1977jdc/statement_from_president_joe_biden_marking_100/ki0n1bq

Why? Because Israel has used US weapons to exterminate more Palestinians every single day of the last 100 days than the total number of hostages taken 100 days ago. So for 100 days, Israel has murdered over 200 Palestinians - over 150 children and women - every. single. day. Over and over. Yesterday. Today. Tomorrow. Killing babies with American bombs. And this is what Joe Biden has to say. Not a single breath used to speak about the thousands of children that no longer breathe because of what he has done and continues to do.

""Harris has a particular edge among the youngest voters: 27 percent of Harris’s donors are under 45, which is more than double the 11 percent of Biden’s donors.""

""And in several swing states, she has expanded upon his appeal to voters who aren’t registered Democrats. In Nevada, for instance, 20 percent of donors who gave only to Harris were not registered Democrats, compared to 15 percent for Biden. In Arizona, 22 percent were not registered Democrats, compared to 18 percent for Biden. Their figures were closer in North Carolina and Pennsylvania, and partisan registration data was not available in Michigan, Wisconsin or Georgia.""

""Slightly more than 10 percent of unique Harris donors this year were voters not registered with either major party, above all the 2020 Democrats except Sanders and Andrew Yang, while 3 percent were registered Republicans, a ratio higher than any candidate except Yang and now-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.""

In a statement given exclusively to The Messenger,  DNC Rapid Response Director Alex Floyd said: “Seven years ago, Donald Trump made clear to Americans and to the world that he would follow through on this plans to undermine the basic tenets of our democracy, inflicting pain and confusion on thousands of Americans who could not reunite with their loved ones, all for the sake of a cynical ploy that did nothing to make America safer or stronger."" 

Trump’s ""cruel and unconstitutional Muslim ban sent a message to millions of Muslim Americans that he would threaten, scapegoat, and villainize them — and now he is promising to do it again if he gets a second term in office,” Floyd added.

“Trump has pledged to be a ‘dictator on day one,’ peddling the same extreme and divisive agenda Americans rejected outright in 2020. Voters will reject hate, bigotry, xenophobia, and Donald Trump again at the ballot box this November.”

Trump signed an executive order in January 2017 banning travel to the United States for 90 days from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The order also suspended the resettlement of Syrian refugees. ",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1abxk32/dnc_slams_trump_for_plans_to_double_down_on/,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1abxk32/dnc_slams_trump_for_plans_to_double_down_on/kjqm872

2024-04-16 12:55:21,politics,Palestine,1c5f05u,kztnb20,Stop Weapons Shipments to Israel,"New Republic Editorial: 
>President Joe Biden should stop immediately the shipment to Israel of weapons being used in its war in Gaza. He possesses not only the legal authority to do so, but a legal obligation, given the Israel Defense Forces’ indiscriminate killing of Palestinian civilians and its obstruction of relief efforts, culminating in its fatal April 1 attack on seven workers for Jose Andres’s World Central Kitchen.[...]

>Like most laws governing the conduct of foreign policy, **Section 6201 and the Leahy law are full of loopholes. A president can waive Section 6201 by alerting Congress** that enforcing it would conflict with national security, and a **secretary of defense or state can bypass the Leahy law by alerting Congress** that the country in question is taking the necessary corrective steps. The Biden administration has yet to avail itself of either escape hatch, probably because it would draw unwelcome publicity.

• Section 6201 of the Foreign Assistance Act “prohibits the United States from providing security assistance or arms sales to any country when the President is made aware that the [foreign] government ‘prohibits or otherwise restricts, directly or indirectly, the transport or delivery of United States humanitarian assistance.“

• March 12, 2024: Senators Urge Biden to Stop Arming Israel, Citing Violation of U.S. Aid Law | An independent and seven Democrats argued in a letter that the administration had run afoul of a part of a law that bars military aid from going to any country that blocks humanitarian aid.

Thousands of protesters gathered in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday to demonstrate against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address before a joint session of Congress.

Netanyahu’s trip to the Capitol has been controversial since House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) first announced his plans to invite the prime minister in May. Several lawmakers declined to attend the joint session given the brutality of the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, and the ongoing investigations into human rights violations committed by the Israeli military in their ongoing siege against Gaza.

Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), the most vocally pro-Palestine member of Congress, did attend Netanyahu’s speech. She wore a Palestinian pin and scarf, and held up a “WAR CRIMINAL” sign as Netanyahu spoke.

To say otherwise is like MAGA stating there is no racism in America. If we can't talk about it, how will we solve the problem.

2024-07-25 16:04:57,politics,Palestine,1ebyk71,lew1tl4,'Monstrous': Hear From An Israeli Hostage’s Relative Arrested During Netanyahu’s Speech To Congress,"> Mor, an Israeli citizen, said he sees the U.S. as the “greatest hope” for the release of his uncle. But as he watched Netanyahu on Wednesday deliver remarks to a joint session of Congress ― from his place in one of the galleries for guests, a seat he got via an invitation from Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) ― Mor couldn’t help himself. During one of the multiple standing ovations Netanyahu received, Mor stood up and yelled into the House of Representatives chamber three times: “1,400 deaths!”

> It was a reference to the initial Israeli estimate of deaths on Oct. 7., which has since been revised to around 1,200.

> “It was on [Netanyahu’s] watch,” Mor told HuffPost, that people like his cousin, Munder’s son, were slaughtered.

> “It’s mind-boggling” to see U.S. legislators applaud Netanyahu, he added, in his first interview since his arrest. “I know half of the people don’t believe a word he says, but still there’s this equation ― that we must fight ― that if you criticize Netanyahu, then you’re helping the antisemites.”

> “I think it’s bullshit: You have to oppose Netanyahu,” Mor continued. “It’s not that you’re an antisemite — you’re truthful.”

> Mor said he was approached by an usher after his third outburst, then arrested by police and brought a holding area, before being driven to a police station. He and five other relatives of Israeli hostages who also attended the speech have been charged under a statute in District of Columbia law that makes it illegal “knowingly, with force and violence, to enter or to remain upon the floor of either House of the Congress,” a spokesperson for the U.S. Capitol Police, Brianna Burch, told HuffPost.

> Mor said he was approached by an usher after his third outburst, then arrested by U.S. Capitol Police and brought to a holding area, before being driven to a police station. He and five other relatives of Israeli hostages ― who also attended the speech, and during it, unveiled protest T-shirts ― have been charged under a statute in District of Columbia law that makes it illegal “knowingly, with force and violence, to enter or to remain upon the floor of either House of the Congress,” a spokesperson for the U.S. Capitol Police, Brianna Burch, told HuffPost.

> The five others issued a joint statement earlier Wednesday evening, stating: “Some of us wore a T-shirt calling on our Prime Minister to finally seal that deal, because this is his responsibility. And for that perceived offense, we were removed from the visitors’ gallery. No matter what, we will continue to fight for those who cannot: our family members being held captive in Gaza.”

> On Tuesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) had threatened people who disrupted the Netanyahu speech with prosecution.

> Relatives of those taken hostage have for months criticized Netanyahu for continuing fighting in the Gaza Strip ― Hamas’ base ― rather than cutting a ceasefire deal to let the captives come home.

> In November, the U.S. helped orchestrate a brief truce and prisoner exchange between Hamas and Israel, freeing dozens of hostages, including Mor’s aunt, cousin and nephew. Mor believes President Joe Biden’s help was “instrumental” in their release. Netanyahu’s government argues it is still prioritizing the freedom of the hostages, including through military raids to free specific groups of them.

> Mor isn’t sure what to do now, he said: He’s been given a court date for Aug. 14 but he is scheduled to head back to Israel on Aug. 2.

> He said it was “ludicrous” that he was arrested during the speech and wants to shift the focus back to Netanyahu. The prime minister brought the families of several hostages to Washington with him, a choice Mor described as “monstrous.”

> “Only an extremely cynical person could even think about doing such a thing,” Mor told HuffPost.

> Omar issued a statement on Mor’s arrest Wednesday night, saying: “He could not stand to listen to his harmful rhetoric. As a family member of an Israeli hostage, he has experienced the agonizing pain of Netanyahu’s failure to bring the hostages home and inability to make a deal. His bravery to call out Netanyahu’s genocide mirrors the sentiment shared by millions of Americans who want to see a permanent ceasefire and an end to this genocide funded by our tax dollars.”

> For now, Mor is determined to keep the focus on Netanyahu and to undercut the prime minister’s attempt to project the impression that he’s respected abroad, especially by the U.S., Israel’s closest ally.

> “He’s not answering the people he’s responsible for. He sees himself as an American statesman and we can see the result: It’s a complete betrayal of his own citizens,” Mor argued.",9,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1ebyk71/monstrous_hear_from_an_israeli_hostages_relative/,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1ebyk71/monstrous_hear_from_an_israeli_hostages_relative/lew1tl4

2024-09-01 15:12:06,politics,Palestine,1f6gjyj,lkzzato,"From lost followers to backlash in the comments, content creators reflect on the DNC","Some highlights from this piece:

>Hanna was one of more than 200 credentialed content creators at the Democratic convention, almost three times as many compared to those at the Republican's convention in July.
>
>The move is part of a larger push by the Democratic Party to reach Americans who don’t consume traditional political news, which includes many younger voters, who disproportionately use TikTok, Instagram, YouTube and Snapchat at higher rates compared to older generations.
>
>The Democratic Party is banking on the support of voters under 30 this fall, and despite increases in turnout over the past few election cycles, it’s a growing generation with largely untapped electoral might.
>
>That goal puts potential value on working with digital creators, who may have more of a direct line to new voters. However, while some influencers who attended the DNC regularly post about news, elections and voting, and likely have political audiences, others, like Hanna, do not.
>
>...
>
>“It's challenging because obviously, it's like you're dealing with an audience that cares about values and issues, which to them is not inherently politics — and if anything has been like quite the opposite of politics,” she said.
>
>Tori Dunlap faced a similar situation. She runs the platform Her First 100K, which helps women learn how to invest and save their money, and has more than 4.5 million followers across social media platforms.
>
>“We saw a hit to our follower counts when I started posting that we were attending the DNC and covering it, which honestly shocked me,” Dunlap said, telling NPR she lost about 10,000 followers on Instagram, where she has about 2.1 million in total.
>
>...
>
>“Posts performed as well as our normal content, if not better,” she said. “The photos of me just absolutely so excited and losing it … We're continuing to see a lot of love on those posts.”
>
>But among that love, some of her followers expressed their disappointment with Dunlap’s decision to attend, so she responded.
>
>“I’m so tired of watching everyone fight in the comments. Just because you vote for a candidate or party doesn’t mean you like everything about them or their policies,” she wrote in the comments. “I was honored to represent my platform and advocate for you all.”
>
>Dunlap told NPR she went to the DNC to encourage her followers to participate and feel they have a voice.
>
>Also, while her brand may be about money, its political roots run deep. Dunlap said that her opposition to former President Donald Trump’s win in 2016 motivated her to help women gain a stronger understanding of their finances. For these reasons, she said she doesn’t see a dip in followers as a loss.
>
>“It's not an airport. You don't need to announce your departure,” she said. “If you don't want to talk about politics, first of all, that's a massive privilege. And second of all, it's OK. You can just leave, and you can find content elsewhere.”

It was interesting to read about the perspectives of some of these creators regarding their experiences and their content from this year's DNC. It's pretty heartening to see a new generation becoming involved in the political discourse, and having communicators or content creators who can provide information and context in a format they use is incredibly useful. Given the nature of social media platforms, it's not unsurprising that some receieved some blowback from their participation in and reporting on the DNC, but hopefully more can feel empowered to deal with this and other critical issues in their content in the months and years to come.",9,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1f6gjyj/from_lost_followers_to_backlash_in_the_comments/,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1f6gjyj/from_lost_followers_to_backlash_in_the_comments/lkzzato

2024-09-23 12:14:47,politics,Palestine,1fniw9o,loii9oa,Has Michael Regan’s EPA Kept Its Promises?,"EPA Administrator Michael Regan became the face of the Biden administration’s commitment to environmental racial justice—and the target of politicians who seek to hobble the agency, Vann R. Newkirk II reports. [https://theatln.tc/sKSE4YKc](https://theatln.tc/sKSE4YKc)

Regan, the EPA’s second Black administrator, focused his agency on addressing environmental racism. Black, Indigenous, Latino, and low-income communities are far more likely to experience environmental problems than people in high-income, majority-white areas. Black people, for instance, suffer 54 percent more pollution from industrial facilities than other Americans, contributing to child-asthma rates that are about twice as high as those of white children. Before the Biden administration, the EPA had been a clear failure in its capacity as a civil-rights watchdog; a 2015 analysis found that the EPA’s Office of Civil Rights had not made a single formal finding of discrimination—ever.

Discrimination can be hard to establish if one must prove intent. To combat this, the EPA’s investigations relied on “disparate-impact theory,” which accounts for the racial impact of specific policy decisions, regardless of whether outright racial bigotry is evident. Disparate-impact theory has been a powerful tool for enforcing civil-rights law, but it’s also controversial.

Among GOP lawmakers, the EPA’s investigations “helped earn the agency a reputation for being ‘woke.’ And, undoubtedly, it was easier to pin that reputation on a Black man,” Newkirk writes. Many Republican attorneys general have found in the EPA and Regan a handy foil for advancing a broader agenda, and hope to use the courts to end all federal civil-rights enforcement based on disparate impact.

Eventually figuring that any case involving disparate impact would be challenged in court—and that an adverse ruling could jeopardize the future of the idea for the whole government—the EPA backed away from some of its investigations. Regan can claim concrete improvements for disadvantaged communities during his tenure. But, Newkirk continues, the EPA will likely finish Joe Biden’s term with a civil-rights-adjudication record “little better than the ones under his predecessors.”

>Like most laws governing the conduct of foreign policy, **Section 6201 and the Leahy law are full of loopholes. A president can waive Section 6201 by alerting Congress** that enforcing it would conflict with national security, and a **secretary of defense or state can bypass the Leahy law by alerting Congress** that the country in question is taking the necessary corrective steps. The Biden administration has yet to avail itself of either escape hatch, probably because it would draw unwelcome publicity. 

• Did Biden waive Section 6201 without alerting Congress?  
• Has Sec. of Defense Austin or Sec. of State Blinken bypassed the Leahy law without alerting Congress?

2024-05-08 18:17:02,politics,Palestine,1cnbe47,l35yqah,Team Trump is warming to TikTok in a big way,"From Semafor's Shelby Talcott:

MAGA Inc., the Donald Trump-aligned Super PAC, joined TikTok on Wednesday, marking the first group affiliated with Trump to do so.

The independent super PAC kicked off its TikTok page with several videos, including one that slammed Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s record of supporting Democrats and going after Republicans, describing him as “a radical leftist.” Another video talked about Trump’s tax cuts and asked viewers whether they could “afford four more years of Joe Biden.” The latest social media account will be used to spread campaign messages, rapid response, and other pro-Trump content.

“There’s millions of voters on TikTok, and @MAGA will deliver President Donald J. Trump’s pro-freedom, pro-America agenda every day with the facts and stories that matter,” Taylor Budowich, CEO of MAGA Inc., said in a statement. “We aren’t trying to set policy, we are trying to win an election.”

Budowich also offered up some insight as to why the organization decided to join TikTok, despite Republican condemnations of the platform’s ties to China: He said they wouldn’t “cede any platform to Joe Biden and the Democrats,” (the Biden campaign launched its own TikTok account in February) and promised that Trump’s “America First agenda will be brought to every corner of the internet.” Fox News first reported the news.

Make it about Netanyahu.  Push for him to step down or for new elections.

Also it pisses off the military/industrial complex, which Biden is embedded with.  His Sec. of Defense is a Raytheon employee.

Problem is Biden is old friends with Netanyahu.  

This whole situation, for the US, would be easily remedied by the Democrats admitting that Biden is a shit candidate and replacing him with someone else (not Harris) and claiming a medical issue would make it impossible for him to complete his Presidential term.

Why? Because the Chemical Facilities Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) are managed by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within DHS.

2024-03-21 13:45:50,politics,Palestine,1bk6dys,kvvynce,Senator McConnell Pushes Back Against Leader Schumer's Call for Israeli Elections,"McConnell: ""It is grotesque and hypocritical for Americans who hyperventilate about interference in our own democracy to call for the Israeli leader's removal.""

In 2015, during the Presidential campaign the Republican congress had Netanyahu address them without notifying the Obama administration, where Netayahu assailed the administration for its support of the nuclear deal with Iran. This was in direct support of Trumps position and was later rewarded by Trump going along with the relocation of Israel's capitol to Jerusalem.  No interference there,  right?

The fact is that Schumer specifically called for Israeli action after the current conflict in Gaza has wound down. We have freedom of speech here, as the poor persecuted Republicans always whine about being suppressed. Schumer has the right to express a loss of confidence in Netanyahu.

There was no mention of support for any other Israeli replacement, it was all about how Bibi is leading Israel down the road to perdition.",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1bk6dys/senator_mcconnell_pushes_back_against_leader/,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1bk6dys/senator_mcconnell_pushes_back_against_leader/kvvynce
