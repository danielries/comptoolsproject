It then creates a profile for each soldier, including personal information such as their name, age, family origin, and army unit. According to TRT, which cited Israel’s Channel 12 News, multiple soldiers have expressed concerns over the account. “I’m afraid they could Google my name and find it there,” one soldier told Channel 12.

The Israeli army declared at first that a mob was attacking a truck carrying aid. A few dozen people were injured because of that.

In the next statement they said oh no not injured but a few dozen people actually died.

In the next statement they said they actually shot warning shots at the mob. And after that they shot their legs.

The next statement was from the government saying that the truck carrying aid was actually driving into people and killing dozens

Youtube? you can still watch youtube videos through FreeTube/ PeerTube/ inviduous and more...

Mail client? use Protonmail or Tutanota

PlayStore? use Aurora store (basically Playstore without signing up) or droidify

Chromebook? install a Linux Distro, a beginner friendly one

I spoke about this occurrence with a family member today. A video of the infero was on TV and I said, ""that's truly hell"" and my uncle said, ""yeah it really is"". I then said, ""Israel is really going to make the Middle East a war zone again"" to which he responded, ""but the Houthis sent a drone attack first"". I asked sarcastically, ""well, why could that have possibly happened?"" He said, ""because the Houthis are an Islamist fundamentalist group and they're terrorists"". I responded, ""or maybe because Israel has had Palestinian under siege for the past 80 years and Palestine has had practically no defense in that time frame until now"". He then left the conversation.

People are so quick to label muslim groups fighting for their countries or interests as terrorists, yet when IOF kills 140k people in Palestine, thats not terrorism. That's counter terrorism. When Yemen helps their suffering ally, that's terrorism. When Israel creates a literal inferno in Yemen, that's counter terrorism.

I remember a quote from somewhere if someone could guide me il edit and acclaim it about ‘look for someone you cannot criticise and that is your enemy’.

Time and time again we find our government officials proposing we are the lands of democracy while our representatives are financed in a way they cannot lose with abundant media support and some parties that dare step away from the will of the west are sabotaged and sunk (you know of what I speak). 

I believe and I wish that this injustice to the Palestinian people will wake the western populous up to the hypocrisy of our leaders due to whoever fills their wallets they represent and not the constituents of who they owe their seat of power to. 

The western governments should truly be ashamed of themselves for betraying the voice of the people they are in place to represent but obviously they will not because they will simply have a ‘hearing’ to deny everything and go on their merry way with tax payers money to live a happy life while the rest of us get arrested in protests for simply asking ‘why?’. Money always wins and the people always lose, it’s time for serious change in my view.

# Israeli Hostages Killed by Their Own Forces

Israel’s military operations have resulted in the deaths of at least three Israeli hostages during a rescue mission in Gaza. These tragic deaths occurred when Israeli soldiers mistakenly shot the hostages despite their attempts to signal their identity and surrender

The incident has deeply affected the nation, prompting demonstrations and public mourning, highlighting the challenges faced in conflict situations where distinguishing combatants from noncombatants is crucial but often difficult

# Hamas’ Losses Among Israeli Hostages

The armed wing of Hamas has stated that these losses among Israeli hostages have been significant, with those still alive living in extremely difficult conditions",56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1bbgpcy/report_israel_has_killed_more_of_its_own_hostages/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1bbgpcy/report_israel_has_killed_more_of_its_own_hostages/ku918nc

Until last year I regretfully couldn’t have pointed to Palestine on a map and I thought Israel was just another country in the middle east.

As an American who has finally taken the time to learn about this conflict I feel a sense of anger akin to being lied to.

Now, I cannot unsee Israel’s evil and its infiltration of my own country.

EDIT 2: This guy was in Beruit with no need to bomb South Lebanon as well. Justifying that Israel could've taken down Hamas leaders without harming the innocent in Gaza.

I could go on. The point is, this so called strategy of assassinations is nothing but a short-term media victory. It has absolutely zero weight on the battlefield or on any resistance groups.

Or that they made a little mistake, and they will try better next time.""

Not fun fact: US Leahy Laws are supposed to limit weapons sales to foreign entities that commit human rights violations. Within the US Leahy Laws, only Israel has a special mention of our trust in their judicial process, that allows Israel to investigate themselves and report to us to determine their own eligibility for further US weapons sales. No other foreign nation gets that parameter. 

It's discussed in further detail in a Guardian article titled [‘Different rules’: special policies keep US supplying weapons to Israel despite alleged abuses

](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/18/us-supply-weapons-israel-alleged-abuses-human-rights)

Excerpt:
The two-page 2021 agreement, which has received little media attention, formalized changes in the Leahy law and included a statement about how Israel has a “robust, independent and effective legal system, including its military justice system”. The US signed more than two dozen similar agreements with other countries at that time – including Greece, Jordan, Georgia, Ukraine and Latvia – but none contain language endorsing the other countries’ military justice systems. ...

Tim Rieser, a longtime senior adviser to Leahy, who helped write the Leahy law in the 1990s, said the inclusion of the language was probably intended to help Israel avoid scrutiny under the Leahy law, because it suggests as a matter of fact that Israel’s military justice system is independent enough to address any alleged human rights violations.

“The language added to the US-Israel agreement, without any consultation with Congress, is factually inaccurate and wrongly suggests that the [Leahy] Law doesn’t need to be applied,” Rieser said.",61,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1d2u4ek/how_many_more_charred_corpses_does_the_president/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1d2u4ek/how_many_more_charred_corpses_does_the_president/l62wbnt

They injured dozens of innocent civilians, including a 10-year-old boy who was killed. Many other children and civilians were injured in this terrorist attack while driving, shopping, or picking up their children from school. The pagers of all doctors and nurses were targeted. With one exception, the American University Hospital in Beirut, which asked staff to replace their pagers ten days ago. We Americans are fools to think that what happens abroad could never happen here. Just think that suddenly your phone, your security system, your children’s tablets are time bombs that explode according to the “whims” of a country. Setting off so many pagers at the same time when you don’t know if all those people are away from the crowd is not murder, it’s terrorism. State terrorism, plain and simple! This was one of the worst terrorist attacks in modern history & the demons responsible for this indiscriminate attack are protected from prosecution by the US. WE MUST PROTEST! This can’t happen again!!!! Israel has set a precedent that is so dangerous to the security of the entire planet.

2024-04-29 06:44:00,Palestine,Israel,1cfoi5h,l1r463y,Why is it illegal in parts of U.S. to boycott 'Israel',"I have been asking myself that question for quite a while. I was an anti apartheid activist against South Africa, and see the same situation now in Israel. It seems like prohibiting peaceful boycotts against Israeli should be seen as a violation of the U.S. Constitution free speech clause, and also the right to assemble. I am hoping an attorney will challenge these laws on constitutional grounds.

Clearly many U.S. citizens support the Palestinian cause, this all the protests on college campuses.  

I personally will continue my boycott of any company that supports the IDF or the illegal expansion of settlements in Palestine.",51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1cfoi5h/why_is_it_illegal_in_parts_of_us_to_boycott_israel/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1cfoi5h/why_is_it_illegal_in_parts_of_us_to_boycott_israel/l1r463y

>David Grossman recounts with shame his meeting with Wadha Isma’il, a Palestinian woman in an Occupied Territory refugee camp. As a small girl, upon working in the family fields, Wadha watched Israeli soldiers blindfold her father, and then heard him shot behind some bushes.

>“I began to cry,” she told Grossman, “The soldiers who had stayed with me asked me: Who is that man to you? I said: ‘He is my father.’ They said: ‘Go to the garden down there, and you’ll see that he is harvesting lettuce and eggplant.’ When I was some distance from them, I glanced back and I saw one of the soldiers aiming his rifle at me. I was frightened and bent over. His bullet hit my neck and came out the other side.”

Oxfam had coordinated with Israel, letting them know where they were going and what they were doing. Despite this, their clearly-marked vehicle was bombed.  
  
Attacks on civilian infrastructure and those who maintain it are clear violations of international humanitarian law.   
  
Israel uses starvation, and lack of drinking water, also a war crime, as a deliberate tactic.

The fact is Zionists don’t want to live with such people and want to maintain the ethnostate - thus when you threaten the dismantling of their ethnostate (from the river to the sea…) they see it as an attack on their religion and ethnicity. 

In essence - they see having to live with Arabs and Muslims in great quantity as somehow a genocide which is laughable.",70,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1d5p2rz/israel_does_not_have_a_right_to_exist/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1d5p2rz/israel_does_not_have_a_right_to_exist/l6nosqz

The Borkum, a cargo ship accused by Spain’s leftist parties Sumar and Podemos of carrying weapons to Israel, refused to stop at the southeastern Spanish port of Cartagena. The decision was communicated at midnight by the shipowner to the Maritime Captaincy and confirmed by sources from Spain’s Ministry of Transportation, who insist that the final destination of the cargo is the Czech Republic, not Israel.

These sources did not rule out that the claim against the Borkum originated in a confusion, as another cargo ship with a confirmed destination of Haifa, Israel, had been previously denied access to Spanish ports.

The shipowner — a German company, although the vessel is flying the flag of Barbuda and Antigua — communicated that the ship would not make the stopover, even though all documentation was in order and it would have had no issues accessing Cartagena port.

On Thursday, the Borkum remained anchored off Cape Tiñoso near Cartagena, where it was scheduled to dock on Friday morning. A protest had been planned at the port. The ship ultimately canceled its stopover in Spain and headed for Slovenia instead

Sumar’s Íñigo Errejón and Podemos’ Irene Montero congratulated each other on social media, claiming the decision proved them right about the Borkum carrying weapons to Israel. Local newspaper La Verdad reported that on Tuesday, the Palestina Libre association and political groups had claimed the Borkum carried weapons for Israel, which ministers denied.",145,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1cv96ir/cargo_ship_full_of_german_explosives_headed_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1cv96ir/cargo_ship_full_of_german_explosives_headed_for/l4nsak4

Yes, Netanyahu has stated over and over in public that he does not want the Palestinians to have a state. Israel also wants the land. It has a growing population because of its massive ultra Orthodox population who have very large families. So of course it is manufacturing reasons to genocide the Palestinians. Its goal in Gaza as stated is to make it uninhabitable. For Palestinians. Israel is driving Palestinians out of the West Bank right now and has been doing so increasingly for months. It is annexing the West Bank to take the land for itself. 

If nothing changes, Israel is going to annex and settle in Gaza and the U.S. isn't going to do anything about it, just like it hasn't done anything in the West Bank or to stop the genocide in Gaza, except enable Israel.",123,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1g7364b/is_israels_plan_to_wipe_out_palestinians_has_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1g7364b/is_israels_plan_to_wipe_out_palestinians_has_the/lsnmzqi

2024-10-19 09:29:27,Palestine,Israel,1g7364b,lsntim4,Is Israel's Plan to Wipe Out Palestinians? Has the World Normalized the Palestinian Genocide?,"Yes, they want to kill as many as possible.

Why? The UK and later the USA continued their colonial policies of the Middle-East after WW2. This strategy of theirs is to install a zealot, fundamentalist elite minority to rule over the majority.

However, after the Suez-crisis, I believe the UK and USA started more unconditionally to support Israel, because of the control over the region Israel provides. Because Israel is completely dependent on American protection for it's survival. However, the unconditional support has made the zionists more radical without any pushback.

Now the zionists have free game, after 60 years of internal radicalization to kill, to murder as many as they want. With the stranglehold the USA has on the UN, nothing really can stop them, and the USA (read  leadership) doesn't really care what happens, as long as they keep control over the Middle-East via Israel.

So no, Israel does not control the USA (which alludes to a real antisemtic trope) the USA controls Israel. USA leadership weaponizes groups like AIPAC to surpress critical voices towards Israel.

Due to UN stranglehold of the Americans, the countries that support Palestine are diplomatically being restrained, and are to wary or weak to militarily intervene.

Then, the other powerblock, the EU, is through NATO vassals to the USA. Due to the war on terror, 9/11, Arab Spring and refugee waves, as well as economic regression due to unfair EU laws on housing and trade, the far right is on the rise in the EU. Due to 20+ years of demonization of muslims, it is fairly easy to paint an anti-Palestine narrative. Also, due to WW2, laws against antisemitism are weaponized to protect the zionist entity from criticism.

Also, one of the most populous nations in the world, India, under Mohdi, has followed a staunch anti-islam policy due to hindu nationalism.

In short, the biggest powerblocs in the world are pro-Palestine genocide, because it politically benefits them, and until the USA steps in or the zionists are defeated, the slaughter will continue.",24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1g7364b/is_israels_plan_to_wipe_out_palestinians_has_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1g7364b/is_israels_plan_to_wipe_out_palestinians_has_the/lsntim4

These raids specifically targeted nine shops located in Ramallah, Jenin, and Hebron. According to both Israeli and Palestinian reports, approximately NIS 10 million (equivalent to $2.8 million USD) were seized during these operations. The money exchange shops affected are branches of five different offices in the West Bank, which Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has designated as “terror organizations.” These offices are allegedly involved in transferring funds to Hamas and Islamic Jihad",79,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1beku4m/israel_has_stolen_28_million_from_palestinian/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1beku4m/israel_has_stolen_28_million_from_palestinian/kutvvvw

1) reddit is primarily an American audience and Americans tend to be much more pro Zionists relative to the rest of the world, including Christian Zionists. They are heavily influenced by the mainstream narrative and their government position. 


2) Reddit is a biased platform and they lean towards being pro israel to appease US stakeholders. Hence why mainstream subs like WorldNews instantly brigade objective news articles that paint Palestinians in a positive light.

At times the pro Israel stuff feels like they are living in a different reality, where they seem to genuinely believe that being opposed to slaughtering as many Palestinians as possible is antisemitic and that it is the only way to avoid another genocide of jews. 

I grew up as a Zionist. Part of my family is Jewish and many of my mentors in academia were Jewish Zionists. I accepted my mentors truths as my truths. Only when I was exposed to realities about the occupation 8 or so years ago did I start doing my own investigation and became a supporter of Palestine. 

I felt very betrayed. I truly believed that Palestine was empty and not valuable land like neighbouring oil rich counties, that Palestinians refused to accept reasonable peace agreements and that all conflicts were started by Palestinians and that the big issue was terrorism perpetrated by Palestinians. I was told that you “can’t reason with suicide bombers because they don’t value life” without being curious as to what conditions/treatment would cause someone to feel that this was their only option to resist. 

I know better now, but many people have been indoctrinated with these same lies.

I would highly recommend watching the documentary Israelism. It’s about how Jewish youth are indoctrinated to be pro Israel from birth through college and also features how some Jewish antizionists went from being zionists to anti Zionist peace activists.",70,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/186l28k/why_is_reddit_so_pro_israel/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/186l28k/why_is_reddit_so_pro_israel/kb9qmb4

A demonstration by the people in a government is to “demonstrate” to the government that people want something against current government policy. The UK is still selling weapons and sending funds to Israel, so what are they protesting exactly? If the UK has the hostages I would understand. 

Obviously they’re having a counter protest to show the world that the sentiment is pro Israel and anti Palestine. I hate this because when you’re anti any people then you’re just racist, but it’s sanctioned by the government so it’s government sanctioned racist demonstrations.

She's just as complicit as he is. Also, to know that Michael is but one of millions of Zionists is genuinely infuriating.

There's lots of live footage from the weeks and months prior to that.

Description: Israeli bulldozers and trucks are paving a new road along the Gaza-Egypt border, a new buffer zone known as the Philadelphi Corridor. And the Israelis are there to stay. It is a hint at Israel's endgame for Gaza. Israel is building such road networks all across the Gaza Strip with some being kilometers wide. These will be fortified with checkpoints watchtowers bases so that using these strategic corridors the Israeli Army will be able to monitor any point in Gaza.

The Delusion of Invincibility: Why Israel Will Lose to Palestinian Resistance

History’s lesson is clear: no occupying force can crush the will of an oppressed people. Israel’s belief in its military might and strategic dominance over the Palestinians is not just flawed — it’s doomed. Here’s why Israel will ultimately lose this war.

The Indomitable Human Spirit

Palestinians fight for their very existence. Decades of brutal occupation have only hardened their resolve. From the Vietnamese against the Americans to the Algerians against the French, history proves that the oppressed will always resist. The Palestinian resistance, born from relentless injustice, cannot be snuffed out by bombs and bullets.

Israel’s heavy reliance on its advanced military arsenal is a misguided strategy. Every airstrike, every ground invasion only fans the flames of Palestinian defiance. Occupying forces have always failed to secure lasting victory through sheer force — Israel is no exception.

Global Sympathy Is Shifting

Every demolished home in the West Bank and every missile strike on Gaza erodes Israel’s standing in the world. The images of Palestinian suffering are rallying global condemnation and support for their cause. Israel’s actions are isolating it diplomatically and strengthening the Palestinian fight.

Occupation is inherently unsustainable. Israel’s policies of land theft, settlement expansion, and the blockade of Gaza fuel the resistance. Suppression only begets defiance. The more Israel tightens its grip, the more the Palestinian spirit of resistance grows.

The Illusion of Security

Israel’s oppressive measures in the name of security create more enemies and insecurity. True security can never be achieved through brutality and injustice. As long as Israel continues its occupation, it will face an unending cycle of violence and retaliation.

The occupation is corroding Israeli society from within. A nation raised on perpetual conflict and moral ambiguity cannot sustain itself. Growing internal dissent against occupation policies signals a weakening resolve.

Israel is rotting from the inside.",224,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1e51bx7/how_israel_is_losing_the_war_not_just_in_public/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1e51bx7/how_israel_is_losing_the_war_not_just_in_public/ldipejx

2024-07-17 07:29:23,Palestine,Israel,1e51bx7,ldks7b1,"How Israel is Losing the War, Not Just in Public Perception, But Also On the Battlefield","It truly feels like Zionist entity goes out of their way to draft the most unserious people into their ‘moral’ army. People who just casually upload TikTok videos of their Geneva violations for the world to see, who post themselves doing blackface and brownface as the Israeli and Western governments try frantically to tell their denizens that Israel is a freedom loving non-racist utopia and it’s actually those evil Arabs who are the real racists. 

Israelis should legit be studied because their country feels almost like a laboratory of sorts researching how bloodthirsty can a nation truly be. Israelis are raised from birth believing themselves to be the superior race and told they have a god given right to conquer, oppress and eventually liquidate the indigenous inhabitants of Palestine, Lebanon, Syria and other countries on the Zionist genocide bucket list. 

Because they are raised in such an ultranationalist country, Israelis are so out of touch with the world to such a degree that they are perplexed as to why people are disgusted at them for jerking off corpses to impregnate Israeli women. Or why people around the world might find it sadistic to throw parties celebrating hundreds of people being murdered in Gaza (like Israeli settlers did back in 2014).

The Zionist Entity has an incentive to lie to the world and present itself as a thriving democracy because it knows its survival depends heavily on public opinion of the countries propping it up. But Zionist Entitarians, especially those in the IDF, go out of their way time and time again to undermine their own government’s already shitty PR campaigns by just being their regular psychotic selves and then acting shocked when the rest of the world finds what they do repulsive.",13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1e51bx7/how_israel_is_losing_the_war_not_just_in_public/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1e51bx7/how_israel_is_losing_the_war_not_just_in_public/ldks7b1

Iran attacked and destroyed its important military bases in retaliation for the bombing of their embassy, it's a proportionate yet strong response, they don't attack civilians wantonly or create hell in response for it. None of it's about putting on a show of any sort.

And it did so by using its most basic decades old missiles while ""Israel"" had to get the help of US, UK, France, and Jordon to deal with it, with additional intel help from Saudis and UAE, costing them over a billion dollars to stop Iranian attack worth millions.

Iran has for the past almost 5 decades shown itself to be truly revolutionary, sacrificing a lot for the cause of Palestine and its stance against western dominance and western funded salafi terrorism who were shockingly whitewashed in the western media, while being surrounded by them, paying heavy one price after another, with their blood over generations, facing the worst demonization, propaganda and lies for fighting literal Al Qaeda in Syria, without asking for anything.

Yemen avoided the Saudi and western backed genocide in good parts due to Iran arming it, who are now blocking ships to prevent another genocide, Al Qaeda was stopped from putting Alawite women in cages while the western world whitewashed them and outright rallied support for them, U.S and ISIS were stopped MAJORLY due to Iran as they ran rampant with the world watched doing little except speaking about it the most, it's Iran in large parts that fought zionists and weakened them and significantly helped better the formerly rag tag Palestinian militias, while the whole world sided with zionists and signed off on the genocide.

Even the regime change fanatic Masih Alinejad, who gets her funding for the US state dept, initially reported about her heart attack, she changed her story only later on after that line was pushed, her CT scan showing that she wasn't attacked, and even monarchist doctors admitted that she had no injuries — they conjured a story which didn't exist the same way they conjured an entire genocide in Xinjiang, and made beheaded babies a thing.

After that arguably the largest bot led online regime change prop took place on the American state dept app against Iran. **In just a month and half there were 350 million tweets, 1/3 of them, i.e 100 million of those by accounts created in the last 2 months (BLM has had 68 million till date)**.

I went to my dentist the other day. I didn’t realize that he is a Zionist but I did know that he’s a Jew and that George W Bush is a friend of his. He’s been my dentist for 15 years. We often had political conversations. So he’s showing me pictures in his phone of his friends security bunkers and bomb shelters in  Israel which are very nice. He will not stop talking about it. 

I sat there in silence because he has a laser which is on my gums. 

I just started to cry. They’re everywhere. 

Not Jews. People who have an insatiable lust for Palestinian blood and want them to die. 

It’s so disgusting. So yes Colombia, 🇨🇴 soon to be my second home. Colombia, for most of its history, has been on the right side of history. Little known fact, Colombian troops helped Haiti become independent be pushing back French colonizers by force. 

Yes to South Africa, who has made it their mission to atone for their terrible sin of apartheid.

2023-11-21 18:24:50,Palestine,Israel,180hn7y,ka6vrnp,Is public opinion on Israel changing ?,"Speaking for America, where I live - yes 100%. There has been a shift happening over the past few years that is accelerating due to the current genocide. 

The shift exists in 2 dimensions. The first dimension is between conservatives and liberals. After the BLM movement a few years ago, many Americans started seeing the plight of Palestinians through the lens of oppressed groups in the US. Still, some “liberals” are showing their true colors right now by still supporting the genocide. They are truly pro war people that pretend to be liberals. 

The second dimension is between young and old. Young people, as evidenced especially by recent polling (look up recent Gallup and nbc polls) are much more sympathetic to Palestine. This is due to several reasons. For one, older generation in the US recall an israel that was portrayed to them as a young, white looking nation fighting for survival against all odds after its people emerged from the tragedy of holocaust. The younger generation sees Israel as the aggressor. The second major shift is that younger people don’t depend on main stream news sources like cnn and Fox News which are notoriously pro Israel in the US.

They spread the lies about Palestinians committing mass rape so that they can commit mass rape. This is entirely abetted, very consciously by Western media apparatuses, who went out of their way to spread the worst, most unfounded, emotionally charged libel against Palestinians and then adopted a policy of categorically refusing to report the actual rapes that 'Israel' commits in hopes that these get bogged down and become the new norm. Western media apparatuses are rape supporters.

>Administrative detention is  the incarceration of people who have not been convicted of – or even charged with –  a crime. Israel uses this extreme power continuously and extensively, detaining hundreds of Palestinians on a regular basis. According to figures published by the Israel Prison Service, in March 2023, Israel was holding 1,017 people in administrative detention, all but 15 of them Palestinians. Ten of the detainees are minors between the ages of 16 and 18. This is the highest number of administrative detainees since April 2003, when Israel held 1,140 administrative detainees.

>Palestinian teenagers from East Jerusalem are pulled out of bed in the middle of the night, unnecessarily handcuffed and then made to spend a long time waiting for their interrogation to begin. Only then, when they are tired and broken, are they taken in for lengthy interrogation sessions, without being given the opportunity to speak to a lawyer or their parents before the questioning begins and without understanding that they have the right to remain silent.

This comes in part due to their ideology and their attempt to kill the future of Gaza. This is also why they're targeting educators, schools, universities and such. Another reason they're lashing out due to the humiliation they faced on Oct 7 and, admittedly, not being able to do anything actual against the resistance in the actual war, by doubling down at the only thing they're good at - killing the most defense less of the oppressed, children, infants in incubators, targeting maternity wards, conquering elementary schools, houses and hospitals and bragging about it on TikTok feeding their sadism. Also keep in mind they've seriously damaged many hospitals in Gaza at this point, destroying many. When there was a massive public outrage of them bombing Al Ahli Baptist Hospital killing 500+ displaced people and patients - zionists came out throwing every kind of comical nonsense to deflect the outrage; blood libel, fake audios, fake videos, everything.

The Israeli government can then claim that any attacks on those illegal settlements constitute “terrorism”, with the U.S. providing arms for Israel to commit retaliatory war crimes, saying “Israel has a right to defend itself”.  Israel can then steal a wider swath of southern Lebanon, claiming that a bigger buffer zone is needed for its safety. 

These plans are also in keeping with settler plans for Gaza. The far-right leader of the illegal settlement movement in Israel, the vile genocide cheerleader Daniella Weiss, has taken fellow extremist settlers on nighttime boat trips to watch in celebration as Israeli (i.e. American) bombs are dropped on Gaza. Israelis want to re-establish settlements in Gaza once enough Gazans have been killed and there’s nothing left to do except clear out rubble. Weiss, who is reportedly close to Netanyahu, Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, says that “from now on Gaza will be completely Jewish”.",21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1ftl6f3/israel_advertising_real_estate_sales_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1ftl6f3/israel_advertising_real_estate_sales_for/lptqe18

In order to successfully accomplish a laser guided strike it is necessary for a platform, such as a drone, to “illuminate” the target with a laser while the missile is launched. In order to achieve accurate targeting, platforms which take part in this kind of targeting, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or fast jets, are equipped with advanced optics and sensor pods. These are capable of extremely high optical magnification.

This is notable because at least one of the vehicles clearly bears the logo of World Central Kitchen on the roof.  It is likely these markings would have been visible from above when the strike was carried out, although this depends on the capability of the optic used to track the vehicle.

Many front groups attempt to assert themselves as a true representative of Australian Jewry.

The Jewish Council of Australia reject the State of Israel as inherently connected to Jews and support the rights of Palestinians. There are some similar groups like the Jewish Voice for Peace. But too be honest these groups are small.

The Australian Jewish Association is the opposite, an outright far-right genocidal organisation. They gets some play with sections of the non-Jewish right wing in Australia, seeing eye-to-eye on Islamophobia basically.

Most Jewish groups in Australia are somewhere between the two above and general sit under the Executive Council of Australian Jewry. They invariably support Zionism but usually more passively or at least less openly bloodthirsty compared to the AJA.
