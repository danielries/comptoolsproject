Chocolate Fudge Cake: 
175g Dark Chocolate (54% Cocoa Solids)
150g Unsalted Butter
3 x Eggs
125ml Sour Cream
50ml Vegetable Oil
2 Tsp Vanilla Extract
150g Caster Sugar
150g Soft Brown Sugar
250g Self-Raising Flour
50g Cocoa Powder
1 ½ Tsp Baking Soda
¼ Tsp Salt
125ml Hot Water
Dark Chocolate Ganache:
 300g Dark Chocolate (54% Cocoa Solids)
450ml Double Cream
25g Unsalted Butter
Decoration:
400g Raspberries
 
1. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas Mark 4. Break the dark chocolate into small pieces and cut your butter into cubes. Then in a large mixing bowl add broken dark chocolate and diced butter. Place the mixing bowl over a pan of simmering water (this is a Bain-Marie). Slowly allow the ingredients to melt and mix until the ingredients have been fully incorporated, then remove the bowl from the pan and allow to cool.
2. In another large mixing bowl, add the eggs, sour cream and vegetable oil. Mix until they have become incorporated.
3. Then add the caster sugar and soften brown sugar into the bowl and mix.
4. Once the chocolate-butter mixture has cooled lightly pour it into the wet ingredients and mix until everything has been incorporated. 
5. Sieve the self-raising flour, cocoa powder, bicarbonate soda, and salt into the wet ingredients and add the hot water at this point. Fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until there are no lumps in the mixture.
6. Divide the mixture into 2 x 20cm Cake Tins.
7. Bake the Chocolate Fudge Cakes for 35-40 minutes. You can tell the cake is baked when a toothpick is placed into the center and no batter sticks to the toothpick. 
8. Once baked leave the Chocolate Fudge Cakes to cool on a wire rack.
9. While the Chocolate Fudge Cakes are cooling, make the Dark Chocolate Ganache.
10. Pour the double cream into a pan and heat until it starts to simmer. Once simmering remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.
11. Break the dark chocolate up into small pieces and large into a mixing bowl. Once the cream has cooled slightly, pour the cream into the bowl (with the chocolate). Mix until all the chocolate has melted and the ingredients have come together. Leave the Dark Chocolate to cool and thicken.
12. Add the butter and mix until all of the butter has been fully incorporated into the ganache. Leave the Dark Chocolate to cool and thicken.
13. Once the Chocolate Fudge Cakes have cooled, place one onto a cake board and then place some of the Dark Chocolate Ganache on top. 
14. Using an off-set spatula spread Dark Chocolate Ganache evenly across the cake.
15. Place another cake layer on top and place more Dark Chocolate Ganache evenly across the cake. Again, using an off-set spatula spread Dark Chocolate Ganache evenly across the cake.
16. Spread Dark Chocolate Ganache around the side of the cake and smoothen the ganache using a bench scraper.
17. Finally add the raspberries on top of the cake and make sure to leave one raspberry off the top of the cake to make it perfectly replicate the Bake Off Cake!

ljdzv15,2024-08-22 15:04:32,baking,cake,1eylkcl,My Bánh bò nướng (Vietnamese Honeycomb Cake) won a ribbon at the state fair!,"Recipe from [Chawj Creations](https://chawjcreations.com/pandan-honeycomb-cake-banh-bo-nuong/). I followed it very closely using metric measurements. I also halved the recipe for a few batches and it still turned out well.

INGREDIENTS

2 cups tapioca flour or starch (265 grams)
1/4 cups rice flour (34 grams)
1 Tbsp double acting baking powder (NOT single acting) (15grams)
1 (14 fl oz) can coconut milk (I use Aroy-D brand) (400ml)
1 1/4 cups sugar (260grams)
1 tsp salt (6grams)
1 tsp pandan extract or more (6grams)
6 eggs (room temp) (300grams)
2 tbsp melted coconut oil (or other neutral oil of your choice) (26grams)
INSTRUCTIONS

1) Preheat the oven to 350’ with the baking pan inside to heat up.

2) In a small pan, add in the coconut milk, sugar, and salt. Heat until the sugar is dissolve but not boiling. You should feel no grittiness on the bottom. Let it cool over ice water if needed for faster preparation. Set aside.

3) In a bowl, measure out the tapioca flour, rice flour, and double acting baking powder. Whisk well. Set aside.

4) In another bowl, crack 6 eggs. With a fork, gently poke the yolks and break it apart along with the whites but do not whisk or create any air bubbles. This will cause too much air pockets in the cake during baking time which cause the cake to deflate once it’s cooled. Then add in the cooled coconut sugar mixture and add in 1 tsp of pandan extract. Add more pandan if it’s too light for you. Mix gently. Then add in the dry ingredients and mix gently. There will be chunks of the starches, but that’s okay. The batter will go over a strainer. You just want to mix the starch well enough into the eggs/coconut sugar mixture just so it’s hydrated (again, don’t create too much air pocket).

5) Then pour the chunky batter over a bowl with a strainer. Use a spatula to break apart any chunky parts. Once it’s been well strained, add in the melted coconut oil. Mix gently. By this time the oven should be preheated and the pan should be nice and hot.

6) Get the pan out of the oven and spray it generously with cooking spray. Pour the batter on and stick it back to the oven. Let it cook for at least 40-45 minutes until the cake is cooked in the middle. I cooked mine for 45 minutes. Then turn off the oven heat, open the oven door slightly and let the cake rest inside for 20 minutes.

7) After 20 minutes of resting, take the cake out, flip it over on a board and cut. You can cool it longer if it’s too hot to handle. Cut into your desire size and enjoy!

CAKE RECIPE:

INGREDIENTS

1.75 cup flour

1.5 teaspoon baking powder

.25 teaspoon baking soda

.25 teaspoon salt

3 eggs

1 cup sugar

.75 cup sour cream or greek yogurt 

.5 cup vegetable oil

zest of two lemons

3 tablespoon lemon juice

1 tablespoon lemon extract

.5 teaspoon vanilla extract

2 tablespoon poppy seeds

DIRECTIONS

Preheat the oven to 350F and line a 9×5 loaf pan with parchment paper and set aside.

In a medium bowl, rub the sugar and the lemon zest together using your fingers to allow the lemon oil to come through in the sugar. (Roughly 5 minutes)

In a mixing bowl cream the eggs, lemon zest sugar, and sour cream together until light and fluffy. (Peaks won’t form but the egg mixture will lighten in color by a few shades) I use a kitchen aid whisk attachment on speed 5 for 7-8 minutes. 

Add in the vegetable oil and mix slowly. Add in the vanilla extract and lemon extract, and mix on medium speed for 2-3 minutes to combine.

Add in the flour, baking powder, baking soda, poppy seeds, and salt and mix just until combined. Do not overmix! Mix just until there are no large lumps or streaks of flour in the batter. 

Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and bake for 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. 

Allow cake to cool completely IN THE PAN before glazing. Glazing in the pan helps to keep the icing on the top only as it sets after 10 minutes or so and stays in place! 

RASPBERRY PURÉE

24 oz Unsweetened Frozen Raspberries

1/4 to 1/2 cup white sugar (or to taste)

1 tsp lemon juice 

Blend room temperature raspberries for 90 seconds. Add blended raspberries to medium sized bowl and add sugar and lemon juice. Whisk together well until sugar has fully dissolved. 

*Optional: After blending raspberries and before incorporating other ingredients you can strain the raspberry purée through a fine mesh strainer to remove the seeds if you prefer a seedless purée. 


LEMON GLAZE 

1.5 cup powdered sugar 

2 tablespoon lemon juice

.5 tablespoon milk

.5 tablespoon unsalted butter melted

In a medium bowl, add the powdered sugar, milk, lemon juice, and melted butter and whisk to combine.

Pour lemon glaze over cake. Immediately spoon stripes of raspberry puree directly on top of lemon glaze (the lemon glaze sets very quickly!).  Use a toothpick and drag through glaze in a zigzag pattern to blend the glaze and purée together. 

*TIP* The lemon glaze sets extremely quickly so I ALWAYS make the raspberry purée first and have it ready before I make the lemon glaze to ensure the smoothest application and end result!","lemon poppy seed loaf cake with lemon and raspberry glaze cake recipe ingredients 1.75 cup flour 1.5 teaspoon baking powder .25 teaspoon baking soda .25 teaspoon salt 3 eggs 1 cup sugar .75 cup sour cream or greek yogurt .5 cup vegetable oil zest of two lemons 3 tablespoon lemon juice 1 tablespoon lemon extract .5 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 tablespoon poppy seeds directions preheat the oven to 350f and line a 9 5 loaf pan with parchment paper and set aside. in a medium bowl, rub the sugar and the lemon zest together using your fingers to allow the lemon oil to come through in the sugar. roughly 5 minutes in a mixing bowl cream the eggs, lemon zest sugar, and sour cream together until light and fluffy. peaks will not form but the egg mixture will lighten in color by a few shades i use a kitchen aid whisk attachment on speed 5 for 7 8 minutes. add in the vegetable oil and mix slowly. add in the vanilla extract and lemon extract, and mix on medium speed for 2 3 minutes to combine. add in the flour, baking powder, baking soda, poppy seeds, and salt and mix just until combined. do not overmix!

We did not have Pectin NH for the compote and was not going to buy some when I only needed 2 grams so I just used corn starch and it worked well.

Lemon Blueberry Cake:

Indulge in the resplendent symphony of our Lemon Blueberry Cake, where the zest of sun-drenched lemons entwines gracefully with the succulent, jewel-like blueberries. Each bite is a crescendo of vibrant citrus notes, delicately balanced by the natural sweetness of ripe berries, creating a harmonious dance upon your palate. The cake, tender and moist, serves as the perfect canvas, elevating the luscious, fruit-laden swirls that adorn it. This confection is a celebration of summer’s bountiful embrace, a tribute to nature’s artistry, and a testament to the exquisite craft of our master pâtissier (hey that's me!).


Vanilla Bean Cake:

Experience the sublime elegance of our Vanilla Bean Cake, a timeless creation that exudes sophistication and grace. The essence of the finest vanilla beans is meticulously infused into every tender crumb, enveloping your senses in a warm, aromatic embrace. The cake’s ethereal texture, both light and decadent, reveals layers of nuanced flavor, each more enchanting than the last.

Thank you very much for all the answers (and u/Ok_Nefariousness4356 for the kind words...).  
I was not expecting such a consensus. Clearly something went wrong, so I will go in the shop tomorrow morning.

To the baker's credit, since I forgot to mention it in my original post:

- the external presentation and flavour were nice. The recipient of the cake was pleased when I presented it (a bit less once we saw the inside).

- I did leave the order until the last minute. When I went in the shop in the morning, asking to pick up this evening, she had to check her schedule. Then said she would be able to bake mine and shift some other orders around. Maybe she bit more than she could chew after all.

Oh well.

The cooking may have done it as well, if it was too hot, that can also make the sugar crystalize like that. You could try researching candy temps and see what you’d want to aim for when making frosting. 

Otherwise, you could try making it the usual way without cooking, and see if that helps while preserving the flavor.

lwt0dyh,2024-11-12 20:29:29,baking,cake,1gpukuv,I made a mocha tres leches cake ☺️,"My teeth hurt from a sugar overload after demolishing one slice, but it’s worth it 😭. 

Preheat oven to 165c. For the sponge cake, whisk together 178g plain flour, 250g sugar, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt & 1 tsp espresso powder in a large bowl then set aside.

In a medium saucepan over a low heat, combine 1 cup whole milk, 235g chopped bittersweet chocolate & 75g cocoa powder. Stir continuously until the chocolate melts & the mixture looks like a chocolate sauce. Let it cool slightly. 

Once slightly cooled, whisk in 2/3s of a cup vegetable oil, 4 eggs and a tsp of vanilla extract. Whisk until smooth then pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and fold in until fully combined. 

Pour batter into a lightly sprayed cake pan then gently tap the pan against the kitchen counter to get rid of air bubbles, or pop them with a toothpick or fork.  Bake the cake for around 30-40 minutes, rotating half way through. Insert a toothpick into the middle & it should come out crumbly but clean, with no wet batter. 

While cake is baking, in another saucepan set over low heat, combine approximately 397g can of sweetened condensed milk, 1 cup evaporated milk, half a cup double cream, 2 tbsp cocoa powder, 1.5 teaspoons of espresso powder & half a tsp of cinnamon. Whisk vigorously until the cocoa, espresso & cinnamon are fully dissolved then set aside to cool.

Let your baked cake cool for around 10 minutes then poke it all over with a toothpick. Slowly pour the warm tres leches mixture evenly over the cake. Let the cake cool fully otherwise your whipped cream mixture will melt.

To make the whipped cream mixture, whisk two cups of cold double cream, 1 tbsp of cocoa powder & 1 tsp of espresso powder. Whisk until soft peaks start forming (don’t overdo it). Spread the whipped cream over the chilled tres leches cake & dust the top with cocoa powder. 

Enjoy!","my teeth hurt from a sugar overload after demolishing one slice, but it is worth it . preheat oven to 165c. for the sponge cake, whisk together 178g plain flour, 250g sugar, 1 2 tsp baking soda, 1 2 tsp salt 1 tsp espresso powder in a large bowl then set aside. in a medium saucepan over a low heat, combine 1 cup whole milk, 235g chopped bittersweet chocolate 75g cocoa powder. stir continuously until the chocolate melts the mixture looks like a chocolate sauce. let it cool slightly. once slightly cooled, whisk in 2 3s of a cup vegetable oil, 4 eggs and a tsp of vanilla extract. whisk until smooth then pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and fold in until fully combined. pour batter into a lightly sprayed cake pan then gently tap the pan against the kitchen counter to get rid of air bubbles, or pop them with a toothpick or fork. bake the cake for around 30 40 minutes, rotating half way through. insert a toothpick into the middle it should come out crumbly but clean, with no wet batter. while cake is baking, in another saucepan set over low heat, combine approximately 397g can of sweetened condensed milk, 1 cup evaporated milk, half a cup double cream, 2 tbsp cocoa powder, 1.5 teaspoons of espresso powder half a tsp of cinnamon. whisk vigorously until the cocoa, espresso cinnamon are fully dissolved then set aside to cool. let your baked cake cool for around 10 minutes then poke it all over with a toothpick. slowly pour the warm tres leches mixture evenly over the cake. let the cake cool fully otherwise your whipped cream mixture will melt. to make the whipped cream mixture, whisk two cups of cold double cream, 1 tbsp of cocoa powder 1 tsp of espresso powder. whisk until soft peaks start forming do not overdo it . spread the whipped cream over the chilled tres leches cake dust the top with cocoa powder. enjoy!","teeth hurt sugar overload demolishing one slice, worth . preheat oven 165c. sponge cake, whisk together 178g plain flour, 250g sugar, 1 2 tsp baking soda, 1 2 tsp salt 1 tsp espresso powder large bowl set aside. medium saucepan low heat, combine 1 cup whole milk, 235g chopped bittersweet chocolate 75g cocoa powder. stir continuously chocolate melts mixture looks like chocolate sauce. let cool slightly. slightly cooled, whisk 2 3s cup vegetable oil, 4 eggs tsp vanilla extract. whisk smooth pour wet mixture dry ingredients fold fully combined. pour batter lightly sprayed cake pan gently tap pan kitchen counter get rid air bubbles, pop toothpick fork. bake cake around 30 40 minutes, rotating half way through. insert toothpick middle come crumbly clean, wet batter. cake baking, another saucepan set low heat, combine approximately 397g sweetened condensed milk, 1 cup evaporated milk, half cup double cream, 2 tbsp cocoa powder, 1.5 teaspoons espresso powder half tsp cinnamon. whisk vigorously cocoa, espresso cinnamon fully dissolved set aside cool. let baked cake cool around 10 minutes poke toothpick. slowly pour warm tres leches mixture evenly cake. let cake cool fully otherwise whipped cream mixture melt. make whipped cream mixture, whisk two cups cold double cream, 1 tbsp cocoa powder 1 tsp espresso powder. whisk soft peaks start forming overdo . spread whipped cream chilled tres leches cake dust top cocoa powder. enjoy!",111,https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1gpukuv/i_made_a_mocha_tres_leches_cake/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1gpukuv/i_made_a_mocha_tres_leches_cake/lwt0dyh,33.86883376104933,0.9783,4.709530201312334,0,1,2,5
